  abstract = {The current study investigated the influence of rewards on very young children's helping behavior. After 20-month-old infants received a material reward during a treatment phase, they subsequently were less likely to engage in further helping during a test phase as compared with infants who had previously received social praise or no reward at all. This so-called overjustification effect suggests that even the earliest helping behaviors of young children are intrinsically motivated and that socialization practices involving extrinsic rewards can undermine this tendency.}

  abstract = {The testing effect is a well-known concept referring to gains in learning and retention that can occur when students take a practice test on studied material before taking a final test on the same material. Research demonstrates that students who take practice tests often outperform students in nontesting learning conditions such as restudying, practice, filler activities, or no presentation of the material. However, evidence-based meta-analysis is needed to develop a comprehensive understanding of the conditions under which practice tests enhance or inhibit learning. This meta-analysis fills this gap by examining the effects of practice tests versus nontesting learning conditions. Results reveal that practice tests are more beneficial for learning than restudying and all other comparison conditions. Mean effect sizes were moderated by the features of practice tests, participant and study characteristics, outcome constructs, and methodological features of the studies. Findings may guide the use of practice tests to advance student learning, and inform students, teachers, researchers, and policymakers. This article concludes with the theoretical and practical implications of the meta-analysis.},

This study aims to analyse the content of twelve papers, where the UDL was adopted. The articles were chosen from several databases and journals based on four criteria: 1) peerreviewed papers, 2) provision of empirical results, 3) focused on UDL as a framework, and 4) published from 2012 to 2015. Then, these studies were analysed according to seven themes: type of results, study beneficiary (learners, teachers, both), sample features, geographical region, data collection techniques, data analysis techniques, and learning modes. Most of the selected studies applied the UDL in a traditional or a blended learning mode, whereas only two studies evaluated its effectiveness in online learning environments. It is noteworthy that the majority of the experiments were carried out in the USA. Additionally, positive results of UDL implementation were yielded in eleven papers. These outcomes suggest that UDL is an efficient approach for designing flexible learning environments and accessible content. Such designs can match a wide mix of learner needs, abilities, background knowledge, educational experience, and cultural differences. However, further research is required in order to confirm the positive impacts of UDL in different educational settings and cultural backgrounds.},

Using combined survey and register data for more than 56,000 students in 825 schools, this article conducts the first empirical test of the argument that instructional strategies which emphasize student responsibility and activity, also referred to as student-centered instruction, increase educational inequality. We analyze whether the impact of student-centered instructional strategies on academic achievement differs for students with different socioeconomic backgrounds. Results suggest that a student-centered instructional strategy has a negative impact on academic achievement in general, and for students with low parental education in particular. Our findings support the argument that the instructional strategy of schools is an important mechanism in generating educational inequality through the stratification of learning opportunities. © 2015 Taylor \& Francis},

They used hierarchical linear modeling with a longitudinal sample of 79 mathematics teachers and their 1,364 secondary school students coming from 33 schools serving disadvantaged communities in Québec (Canada). Results indicate that teachers’ self-reported beliefs directly influenced student academic experience. However, they did not influence more importantly low-achieving than high-achieving students. Such findings suggest that in schools serving low socioeconomic status students, teachers should be made aware of the role their attitudes can play on students’ cognitive engagement and achievement. Special efforts should also be made to help them develop positive attitudes toward all students.},

Data were gathered at six case study sites in France using semidirective interviews to explore how creative people experience their creativity and motivation in various contexts. Data analysis suggested a 2 × 2 model of the types of intrinsic motivation for creativity composed of two creativity dimensions based on the relationship to the setting (independent vs. dependent) and the focus of the creative behavior (egocentric vs. other-centered). The model suggests promising avenues for further research, and the development of theory about the complex relationships between intrinsic motivation and creativity. Furthermore, the model suggests possible insights into ways to encourage and support intrinsic motivation, and hence creativity, in organizations.},

  abstract = {These studies examine employees’ emotional reactions to performance feedback from their supervisors as well as subsequent effects on attitudes and (intentions to show) affect-driven work behaviors (counterproductive behavior, turnover, citizenship, and affective commitment). A pre-study (N= 72) illustrates that employees regularly receive performance feedback from supervisors and that this feedback elicits different positive and negative emotions. Next, a scenario experiment (Study 1) comparing the effects of positive/negative feedback given in public/private was conducted, with a student sample (N= 240) and a sample of working adults (N= 107). In both samples, feedback has an impact on emotions and subsequently on work attitudes and behavioral intentions. The results from the scenario experiment were validated in a survey study (Study 2) among employees of a for-profit research firm (N= 86) who reported on recalled emotions and work behaviors after receiving performance feedback during appraisals. Again, different types of feedback relate to different emotions. In turn, these emotions were related to subsequent work behaviors and attitudes. Together, these studies show that feedback affects recipients’ emotions and that such emotional reactions mediate the relationship between feedback and counterproductive behavior, turnover intentions, citizenship, and affective commitment. Ces travaux abordent les réactions émotives des salariés suite au feedback sur leurs performances en provenance de leur supérieur, ainsi que l’impact sur les attitudes et, au niveau des intentions, sur les conduites professionnelles soumises aux affects (comportements contre-productifs, démissions, citoyenneté et implication affective). Une préenquête (N= 72) a montré que les salariés reçoivent régulièrement des informations sur leurs résultats de la part de leur supérieur et que cette situation provoque des émotions à la fois positives et négatives. Ensuite, une expérience (Etude n° 1) comparant les conséquences d’un feedback positif ou négatif exprimé en public ou en privé a été menée à bien sur un échantillon d’étudiants (N= 240) et sur un échantillon de travailleurs (N= 107). Dans les deux cas, la rétroaction avait des retombées sur les émotions et par suite sur les attitudes professionnelles et les intentions comportementales. Les conclusions de cette expérience ont été confirmées lors d’une enquête (Etude n˚ 2) réalisées auprès de salariés d’une société commerciale qui décrirent leurs émotions et leurs comportements professionnels à l’issue d’une rétroaction sur leur performance lors d’une évaluation. Comme prévu, les différentes sortes de feedback sont en relation avec des émotions différentes; puis ces émotions provoquent des attitudes et des conduites professionnelles spécifiques. Au total, ces travaux montrent que le feedback affecte les émotions des individus concernés et que ces réactions émotives s’insèrent dans la relation entre la rétroaction et les comportements contre-productifs, les projets de démission, la citoyenneté et l’implication affective.},

In this article, we suggest that clients can extract greater benefits when practitioners adopt more sophisticated approaches to strengths intervention. We introduce an alternative approach that we call ‘strengths development’. This approach is distinguished by the view that strengths are not fixed traits across settings and time (the dominant, contemporary approach to personality). Instead, we adopt dynamic, within-person approaches from personality science to research, assessment, and interventions on strengths. Specifically, strengths are highly contextual phenomena that emerge in distinctive patterns alongside particular goals, interests, values, and situational factors. Strengths are potentials for excellence that can be cultivated through enhanced awareness, accessibility, and effort. Finally, we outline potential psychological risks associated with the strengths perspective that are worthy of explicit discussion with clients.

Method: The experiment consisted of inducing either a positive emotion (i.e., joy, pride) or a neutral state to 10-year-old children using an autobiographical recall task. Once the induced state was evaluated, children were submitted to a reading/comprehension task of a neutral text. When they finished reading this text, a questionnaire was used to assess not only their memory of the information provided in the text, but also their ability to make inferences. Results: Our main results highlighted a positive effect of joy on children's inference making. Conclusion: This study confirmed the relevance of taking into account the emotional state of children engaged in knowledge acquisition situations at school.},

The article identifies considerable gaps in knowledge about the nature of content goals students bring to the classroom, interrelations among goals, and the effects of environmental conditions on goals.

  abstract = {Examined emotional competence in 87 children, aged 7-10 years, who varied with respect to reports of aggressive behavior to determine whether individual differences in emotional competence characterize children with higher levels of aggressive behavior. Emotional competence was assessed during a 1-hr lab visit that included (a) an observational period consisting of a modified disappointment paradigm, (b) assessment of cognitive and language abilities, and (c) 2 structured emotion interviews. Children with higher levels of aggressive behavior exhibited more intense and frequent expressions of anger, both as reported by mothers and as observed during the disappointment paradigm. Less sophisticated ability to identify the causes of emotion also characterized children with higher levels of aggressive behavior. Gender moderated the relation between aggressive behavior and type of emotion identified such that reports of happiness (in response to receiving a disappointing prize) were associated with lower levels of reported aggressive behavior for boys. The value of assessing children's emotional competence in the context of an emotionally arousing situation is suggested by these findings.},

In Experiment 1, we investigated children's exploratory play after an adult pedagogically demonstrated a function of a toy, after an interrupted pedagogical demonstration, after a naïve adult demonstrated the function, and at baseline. Preschoolers in the pedagogical condition focused almost exclusively on the target function; by contrast, children in the other conditions explored broadly. In Experiment 2, we show that children restrict their exploration both after direct instruction to themselves and after overhearing direct instruction given to another child; they do not show this constraint after observing direct instruction given to an adult or after observing a non-pedagogical intentional action. We discuss these findings as the result of rational inductive biases. In pedagogical contexts, a teacher's failure to provide evidence for additional functions provides evidence for their absence; such contexts generalize from child to child (because children are likely to have comparable states of knowledge) but not from adult to child. Thus, pedagogy promotes efficient learning but at a cost: children are less likely to perform potentially irrelevant actions but also less likely to discover novel information. © 2010.},

Task value and test anxiety were hypothesized to mediate these relationships. Consistent with previous reports, domain-specific self-constructs such as self-efficacy and self-concept were better predictors of task value and achievement than was general self-esteem. Task value and test anxiety significantly mediated only the rela- tionships of self-efficacy assessed by the Bandura-type scale to achievement. These domain-specific relationships tended to be stronger for middle school than elementary school stu- dents and in mathematics than language arts.},

  abstract = {Emotional Competence (EC), which refers to individual differences in the identification, understanding, expression, regulation and use of one’s own emotions and those of others, has been found to be an important predictor of individuals’ adaptation to their environment. Higher EC is associated with greater happiness, better mental and physical health, more satisfying social and marital relationships and greater occupational success. While it is well-known that EC (as a whole) predicts a number of important outcomes, it is unclear so far which specific competency(ies) participate(s) in a given outcome. This is because no measure of EC distinctly measures each of the five core emotional competences, separately for one’s own and others’ emotions. This lack of information is problematic both theoretically (we do not understand the processes at stake) and practically (we cannot develop customized interventions). This paper aims to address this issue. We developed and validated in four steps a complete (albeit short: 50 items) self-reported measure of EC: the Profile of Emotional Competence. Analyses performed on a representative sample of 5676 subjects revealed promising psychometric properties. The internal consistency of scales and subscales alike was satisfying, factorial structure was as expected, and concurrent/discriminant validity was good.},

Exploratory factor analyses allowed the validation of a first version of the Academic Commitment Scale. Correlational and multiple regression analyses permitted the corroboration of the hypothesis pertaining to the positive relationship between academic commitment and personal well-being amongst students. Exploratory and confirmatory analyses led to the corroboration of the hypothesis pertaining to the mediating role of academic commitment in the association between students’ self-determination and personal well-being. The worth of using academic commitment, self-determination, and personal well-being as main targets of investigation while trying to elaborate a model of optimal academic functioning is discussed.

  abstract = {Dans le contexte de développement de politiques inclusives, de nombreux dispositifs cherchent à agir à différents niveaux institutionnels pour favoriser la prise en compte des besoins éducatifs particuliers (p. ex. Prud’Homme, Duchesne \& Bonvin, 2017). Parmi ces dispositifs, nous nous intéressons à ceux pilotés directement par les enseignant·es. En effet, ces professionnel·les sont en relation directe avec les élèves et ont une influence particulièrement déterminante dans la réalisation des visées inclusives. C’est dans cet esprit que nous avons conçu un dispositif d’intervention pédagogique ayant pour objectif de soutenir le développement et maintien des relations positives entre les élèves en contexte scolaire inclusif. La conception de cette intervention est basée sur la théorie des 24 forces personnelles (Peterson \& Seligman, 2004), qui sont considérées en tant que traits de caractère stables, dont un nombre croissant de recherches montre qu’elles ont un effet dans le développement des relations positives entre élèves (gratitude, sens de la justice, persévérance, etc). Le dispositif est conçu dans le but de développer un langage pour désigner des forces dans la classe, identifier les forces des pairs ainsi que les siennes, les utiliser dans de nouveaux contextes, puis enfin, cultiver la diversité des ressources personnelles du groupe. Pour décrire et observer les effets de ce dispositif, nous considérons les enjeux de l’inclusion sous l’angle du climat de classe. Cette notion se définit comme l’ensemble des conditions propices à l’apprentissage des élèves (p.ex., Gaudreau, 2017). Parmi ces conditions, Gaudreau cite la création et le maintien par l’enseignant·e de relations positives entre élèves. La réussite de l’inclusion scolaire semble en effet dépendre notamment de la manière dont les élèves font l’expérience de la diversité dans le vivre ensemble. Cette contribution présentera les savoirs et principes théoriques qui fondent la conception du dispositif pédagogique conçu pour soutenir le climat de classe, ainsi que ceux qui fondent l’analyse des effets produits. Comme illustration de notre propos, nous nous baserons sur les données exploratoires récoltées dans une classe pilote d’élèves de 11-12 ans incluant un jeune avec un trouble du spectre autistique. Les données concernant les représentations des élèves sont recueillies à l’aide d’un questionnaire informatisé contenant des questions thématiques ouvertes. En ce qui concerne les représentations à propos des relations entre pairs, les résultats soulignent la motivation importante des élèves pour l’intervention et leur sentiment que les relations entre eux progressent grâce à l’activité sur les forces qui met en lumière les ressources des camarades plutôt que leurs faiblesses. A partir de la conception de notre dispositif et de ces premiers indices du terrain, nous discuterons les perspectives de développement de la recherche et des activités pédagogiques centrées sur les forces personnelles. Celles-ci sont à voir, selon notre perspective théorique de chercheurs et selon les savoirs qui émanent de notre recherche et de celles d’autrui, en tant que levier dans le développement des relations positives entre élèves, aspect que nous considérons crucial pour qualifier un contexte d’inclusif.},

  abstract = {Recent work in the field of positive psychology interventions has shown that attrition rates appear to be lower compared to classic cognitive and behavioral therapies (CBT). Positive psychology interventions are distinct from first and second generation CBT in that work is mainly focused on functional dimensions in the patient and on the acceptance of problematic aspects rather than on problem-solving strategies. This leads to higher levels of vitality, meaning in life and motivation in patients. On the other hand, serious play allows focus on the patient's resources and values by fostering a state of complete immersion in the activity that generates feelings of control and satisfaction (i.e., flow experience; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). From these perspectives, a new tool for practitioners has been proposed and assessed in our study. More precisely, this new serious play is consistent with the principles of positive psychology (Seligman, 2014) that point to a more pleasant (i.e., positive emotions), shared (i.e., relationship) and meaningful life, oriented towards engagement and leading to feelings of achievement. Aim This study evaluates the effects of positive serious play (PSP) and its effectiveness compared with a classical CBT approach. One of the particularities of this research is that it does not oppose two therapeutic strategies but questions psychotherapists’ practices and tries to broaden their panel of interventions in order to provide ever more personalized patient support. Method Twenty-three subjects (average age 43; sd~=~10.8) took part in the survey. The sample was made up of predominantly women. Problems which motivated the consultation were either personal (12 subjects; 52.2 \%), or related to family (5 subjects; 21.7 \%), or to work (4 subjects; 17.4 \%), or to social relations (2 subjects; 8.7 \%). Subjects were divided into small groups of 4–5 participants according to therapeutic approaches which were compared; on the one hand, a positive serious play procedure (PSP) gathered participants (n~=~14) around a new board game inspired by the Peterson and Seligman's 2004 character strengths (for more details, see http://motivesens.fr), and, on the other hand, a classical CBT intervention focused on problem solving (n~=~9). Assessments were carried out before (T0) and after (T1) the consultation and 6 months later (T2). Measures of depression, but also, positive dimensions (e.g., optimism, subjective well-being, self-confidence, self-esteem) were considered. Although the question concerns a “problem”, the assessment of positive functioning here allows a more nuanced understanding of how the patient copes in every procedure. Results Both CBT and PSP increase. Intragroup analyses highlight that, unlike the CBT group, the PSP approach increased self-esteem in the short term (t(13)~=~7.623; p.adj~{$<~$}0,001) and, in the long term, life-satisfaction (t(13)~=~2.337; P~=~0,036) and two dimensions of psychological well-being, i.e., autonomy (t(13)~=~3.543; P~=~0,004) and positive relationships (t(13)~=~3.417; P~=~0.005). However, subjective well-being was not impacted (F(2,26)~=~1.915; P~=~0.167). The only significant intergroup difference was that the participants of the positive serious play reported more positive relationships than the CBT group in the long term (F(1,42)~=~5.15; η2part.~=~0.197; P~=~0.034). Conclusion This pilot study underlines the fact that the new positive serious play interventions appear to have similar effects to a classical CBT intervention. The major difference between the two strategies is that PSP seems to target primarily psychological (authentic) well-being while CBT impacts subjective (conditional) well-being. According to Prochaska and Di Clemente (1982), it appears that the personal newfound resources in the PSP group contribute to fostering the client's “feeling of autonomy”. At the same time, group interactivity encourages patients to open themselves up to others. In practice, the positive serious play offers a new therapeutic strategy to help patients solve problems (e.g., symbolism, playfulness; Behr, 2009). Recommendations to adapt this new practice tool to different therapeutic settings as well as the limitations of the study (e.g., sample size of the study, subjective assessment of the problem severity) are discussed.},

This meta-analysis systematically reviews group-design studies testing the efficacy of training to improve implementation of interventions for students with disabilities. The mean effect size of educator training on implementation fidelity was g = 1.08, and results from meta-regression analysis suggest training that involves a combination of two specific training strategies (i.e., modeling and performance feedback) was associated with improved implementation fidelity. Increased duration of training was not associated with larger effects. Considered alongside findings from the single-case design literature, these results suggest that how educators are trained is a more important consideration than the number of hours they spend in training.},

  abstract = {The National Child Traumatic Stress Network in the United States reports that up to 40\% of students have experienced, or been witness to, traumatic stressors in their short lifetimes. These include home destabilization, violence, neglect, sexual abuse, substance abuse, death, and other adverse childhood experiences. The effects of trauma on a child severely compound the ability to self-regulate and sustain healthy relationships. In the classroom, the effects of trauma may manifest as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiance disorder, reactive attachment, disinhibited social engagement, and/or acute stress disorders. In this article, we contend that the classroom can be positioned as a powerful place of intervention for posttraumatic healing both in the context of special education and in mainstream classrooms that contain trauma-affected students. The current landscape of trauma-informed practice for primary and secondary classrooms has focused on teaching practices that seek to repair emotional dysregulation and fix broken attachment. In working for more than a decade with mainstream and specialist schools, we have discovered that positive psychology has a role to play in contributing to trauma-informed learning. We argue that combining trauma-informed approaches with positive psychology will empower and enable teachers to promote both healing and growth in their classrooms. This article presents scientific and practice-based evidence to support our claim. We present education interventions aimed to build positive emotions, character strengths, resilient mindsets, and gratitude, and show how these can be embedded in the daily routines of classroom learning to assist struggling students.},

Existing trauma-informed education focuses on repairing regulatory abilities and repairing disrupted attachment in students. How-ever, a dual-continua model of mental health suggests that repairing deficits is only part of the education response needed to nurture well-being in trauma-affected students. Trauma-informed education can be conceived from both a deficit per-spective (e.g., what deficiencies or developmental struggles does this student face?) and a strengths perspective (e.g., what psychological resources does this student have to build upon for future success?). This paper develops the strengths-based trauma-informed positive education (TIPE) approach which proposes three domains of learning needed for trauma-affected students: repairing regulatory abilities, repairing disrupted attachment, and increasing psychological resources. It is argued that the three domains support each other via synergistic interactions which create upward spirals to in-crease psychological growth. The TIPE model will make a contribution to research in positive education, positive psy-chology, and traumatology, with the applied context of assisting classroom teachers and school-based practitioners to meet the complex behavioral, cognitive, and relational needs of students struggling in schools.},

  abstract = {To date, most early intervention programs have been based on emotion regulation strategies that address dysfunctional cognitive appraisals, problem-solving skills, and rumination. Another emotion regulation strategy, 'acceptance' training, has largely been overlooked. To examine the efficacy of this strategy, a school-based mental health program combining positive psychology with acceptance and commitment therapy (Strong Minds) was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial with a sample of 267 Year 10 and 11 high-school students in Sydney, Australia. Mixed models for repeated measures examined whether the program led to reductions in symptoms amongst students who commenced the program with high depression, anxiety, and stress scores, and increased wellbeing scores amongst all students. Results demonstrated that compared to controls, participants in the Strong Minds condition with elevated symptom scores (n = 63) reported significant reductions in depression (p = .047), stress (p = .01), and composite depression/anxiety symptoms (p = .02) with medium to strong effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.53, 0.74, and 0.57, respectively). Increased wellbeing (p = .03) in the total sample and decreased anxiety scores (p = .048) for students with elevated symptoms were significant for Year 10 students with medium effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.43 and 0.54, respectively). This study tentatively suggests that including the emotion regulation strategy of acceptance in early intervention programs may be effective in reducing symptoms and improving wellbeing in high school students. Further research to investigate the generalizability of these findings is warranted.},

In the late 1980s, neuroimaging research indicated that ACC was active in many studies of cognition. The findings from EEG studies of a focal area of negativity in scalp electrodes following an error response led to the idea that ACC might be the brain's error detection and correction device. In this article, these various findings are reviewed in relation to the idea that ACC is a part of a circuit involved in a form of attention that serves to regulate both cognitive and emotional processing. Neuroimaging studies showing that separate areas of ACC are involved in cognition and emotion are discussed and related to results showing that the error negativity is influenced by affect and motivation. In addition, the development of the emotional and cognitive roles of ACC are discussed, and how the success of this regulation in controlling responses might be correlated with cingulate size. Finally, some theories are considered about how the different subdivisions of ACC might interact with other cortical structures as a part of the circuits involved in the regulation of mental and emotional activity.},

  abstract = {If there is one thing that all college and university teachers want their students to learn, it is to think critically. Teachers who wish to challenge and thereby further develop their students' intellectual skills seldom, if ever, do so by asking them to memorize their textbooks and class notes. To be sure, highly effective teachers realize that the basic facts and figures related to their discipline will change with time, so teaching only these things is far less important than teaching students how to think about them (Buskist, 2004). Thus so-called master teachers use facts and figures in the service of teaching critical thinking skills. In psychology, these teachers attempt to teach their students to think like scientists—or more specifically psychological scientists—in understanding basic psychological principles and how these principles translate into governing everyday life. However, as Slife, Reber, and Richardson (2005) have warned, psychologists need to be mindful of the assumptions and values embedded within their approach to thinking critically lest they err in their own ability to think critically about critical thinking. In this chapter, we explore the general characteristics of critical thinking and the key elements involved in the effective teaching of critical thinking. Our goal is to provide some insight into the nature of critical thinking, to examine why students sometimes resist the call to think critically and why teachers may resist asking their students to think critically, and to offer suggestions for how to infuse critical thinking into any psychology course.

We will bring to mind social and physical environmental variables with which children and adolescents interact frequently and, through a literature review, we will enlighten environmental variables that are susceptible to induce behavioural disorders and psychological variables that modulate children's and adolescent's relations to environment.

  abstract = {Research in the field of positive psychology for children and young people has accumulated, and evidence shows that strength-based interventions can be beneficial in terms of wellbeing and school life outcomes. However, populations which are at higher risk of being excluded from school have not been adequately represented in the literature.  The study is designed to address two significant areas. Firstly, it aspires to define the effectiveness of strength-based techniques for adolescents, including those who are at risk of school exclusion. Secondly, it aims to clarify how to improve professional practice for educational psychologists (EPs) and educators when using these approaches. For the purposes of the study, a mixed methods approach was adopted and a strength-based intervention programme was implemented in three secondary schools of one Local Authority.  Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used to collect data about the effect of the intervention and ascertain potential areas of improvement. The findings reveal that although the intervention did not result in statistically significant improvements, pupils at risk of exclusion (AROE) seemed to have been affected more than pupils not AROE.  Using Thematic Analysis, participants’ and facilitators’ views were captured into themes, which revealed that self-concept, social skills and strengths development were enhanced through the programme. In addition, this analysis highlighted the different components that contributed to helpful and unhelpful practice. The study offers knowledge and perspectives in terms of school applications for supporting pupils AROE and not AROE, and canvasses strategies that can be embedded within the school curriculum in order to inspire educators working with vulnerable populations. Conclusions and recommendations about professional practice are also presented.},

  abstract = {A novel artificial glutathione peroxidase mimic consisting of a selenocystine-di-beta-cyclodextrin conjugate (selenium-bridged-6, 6'-amino-selenocystine-6,6'-deoxy-di-beta-cyclodextrin), in which selenocystine is bound to the primary side of beta-cyclodextrin through the two amino nitrogen groups of selenocystine, was synthesized. The glutathione peroxidase activities of the mimic-catalyzed reduction of H(2)O(2), tert-butylhydroperoxide, and cumene hydroperoxide by glutathione are 4.1, 2.11, and 5.82 units/micromol, respectively. The first activity was 82 and 4.2 times as much as that of selenocysteine and ebselen, respectively. Studies on the effect of substrate binding on the glutathione peroxidase activity suggest that it is important to consider substrate binding in designing glutathione peroxidase mimics. The detailed steady-state kinetic studies showed that the mimic-catalyzed reduction of H(2)O(2) by glutathione followed a ping-pong mechanism, which was similar to that of the native glutathione peroxidase.},

IPOD is presented as both a radical break from the problem solving approaches that have come to dominate the field, as well as a homecoming to OD’s original affirmative spirit. The converging fields that inform the theory and practice of IPOD are detailed: Appreciative Inquiry, positive organizational scholarship, positive psychology, design theory, and the rise of sustainable enterprises. The theory of change underlying IPOD is articulated, including the three stages in creating strengths-based organizational innovation: 1) the elevation-and-extension of strengths, 2) the broadenand- building of capacity, and 3) the establishment of the new-and-eclipsing of the old. Recent work from the city of Cleveland, Ohio illustrates how these stages unfold. The chapter concludes with an agenda for evolving the field of IPOD, calling for a focus on designing positive institutions that refract and magnify our highest human strengths outward into society.},

  abstract = {Efficacy beliefs have been found to have significant influence on effort and persistence, and are associated with protective factors such as resilience, personal well-being and achievement (Bandura, 1997). The effects of positive psychology in schools have received little attention to date. However, since positive psychology offers a focus on the positive aspects of human experience (Seligman \& Csikszentmihalyi, 2000) we theorised that it could effect positive changes in teachers' efficacy beliefs. A mixed-methods approach was used in a small-scale study of staff in two primary schools. Interview and focus group data informed the development of a questionnaire that was subsequently used to gather pre- and post-intervention data. Staff in one school were introduced to aspects of positive psychology and participated in an intervention designed to cause reflection on good things'. Staff in a second school acted as a control group. Findings suggest that efficacy beliefs had been enhanced for staff who had participated in the intervention, but not in the comparable school where staff had acted as a control group. Implications and limitations of the study are discussed and suggestions made for future research.},

The exercise of dictation implies complex cognitive activities and for this reason is an interesting task to study the emotion-cognition interactions in the school context. In reference to empirical studies about emotion influence on problem solving activities, the hypothesis that the emotional content (happy, sad or neutral) of a text read to children will found a congruent emotional state with the valence of the text is tested. The results show that the spelling success varies according to the valence of the read text. This effect is not mediated by an emotional state produced by the text. The best scores are observed with the neutral text. The dictation drawn from the sad text is carried out more successfully than that drawn from the happy one. An interaction between the valence of the read text, the spelling level (evaluated using a pilot dictation) and orthographic dimensions also appears. The whole of the results is interpreted in terms of orientation on the emotional content and its distracter effect compared to the principal task of spelling.

Recent research has deepened scientific understanding of the development of prosociality—efforts to promote the welfare of others. In this article, we discuss two key insights about the emergence and early development of prosocial behavior, focusing on the development of helping. First, children’s motivations and capabilities for helping change in quality as well as quantity over the opening years of life. Specifically, helping begins in participatory activities without prosocial intent in the first year of life, becoming increasingly autonomous and motivated by prosocial intent over the second year. Second, helping emerges through bidirectional social interactions starting at birth: Caregivers and other individuals support the development of helping in a variety of ways, and young children play active roles that often influence caregiver behavior. The question now is not whether but how social interactions contribute to the development of prosocial behavior. Recent methodological and theoretical advances provide exciting avenues for future research on the social and emotional origins of human prosociality.},

It then shows how this framework leads to a set of design principles that can be employed to design programs in areas including health, education, productivity, agriculture, finance, and the delivery of public services. Finally, it offers some reflections on the ways in which these insights and design principles can be incorporated into existing and planned programs to improve their reach and effectiveness.},

As these previous studies have not reported consistent outcomes supporting this idea, we therefore evaluated scholastic development in a cross-sectional study of kindergarten and elementary school-age students, with an emphasis on the three core executive measures of cognitive flexibility, working memory update, and selective attention (inhibition). Two hundred and one (201) children underwent a complete assessment: half of the participants were from Montessori settings, while the other half were controls from traditional schools. The results confirmed that Montessori participants outperformed peers from traditional schools both in academic outcomes and in creativity skills across age groups and in self-reported well-being at school at kindergarten age. No differences were found in global executive functions, except working memory. Moreover, a multiple mediations model revealed a significant impact of creative skills on academic outcomes influenced by the school experience. These results shed light on the possibly overestimated contribution of executive functions as the main contributor to scholastic success of Montessori students and call for further investigation. Here, we propose that Montessori school-age children benefit instead from a more balanced development stemming from self-directed creative execution.},

  abstract = {We compared students’ self-reported perception of learning with their actual learning under controlled conditions in large-enrollment introductory college physics courses taught using 1) active instruction (following best practices in the discipline) and 2) passive instruction (lectures by experienced and highly rated instructors). Both groups received identical class content and handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the instructor made no effort to persuade students of the benefit of either method. Students in active classrooms learned more (as would be expected based on prior research), but their perception of learning, while positive, was lower than that of their peers in passive environments. This suggests that attempts to evaluate instruction based on students’ perceptions of learning could inadvertently promote inferior (passive) pedagogical methods. For instance, a superstar lecturer could create such a positive feeling of learning that students would choose those lectures over active learning. Most importantly, these results suggest that when students experience the increased cognitive effort associated with active learning, they initially take that effort to signify poorer learning. That disconnect may have a detrimental effect on students’ motivation, engagement, and ability to self-regulate their own learning. Although students can, on their own, discover the increased value of being actively engaged during a semester-long course, their learning may be impaired during the initial part of the course. We discuss strategies that instructors can use, early in the semester, to improve students’ response to being actively engaged in the classroom.},

These skills are critical for success in all life's aspects and are sometimes more predictive than even IQ or socioeconomic status. Understandably, there is great interest in improving EFs. It's now clear they can be improved at any age through training and practice, much as physical exercise hones physical fitness. However, despite claims to the contrary, wide transfer does not seem to occur and 'mindless' aerobic exercise does little to improve EFs. Important questions remain: How much can EFs be improved (are benefits only superficial) and how long can benefits be sustained? What are the best methods for improving EFs? What about an approach accounts for its success? Do the answers to these differ by individual characteristics such as age or gender? Since stress, sadness, loneliness, or poor health impair EFs, and the reverse enhances EFs, we predict that besides directly train EFs, the most successful approaches for improving EFs will also address emotional, social, and physical needs.},

  abstract = {The current study examined the role of naturally-occurring negative and positive emotion expressivity in kindergarten and children's effortful control (EC) on their relationships with teachers, academic engagement, and problems behaviors in school. Further, the potential moderating role of EC on these important school outcomes was assessed. Emotion and engagement were observed at school. EC was assessed by multiple methods. Teachers reported on their student–teacher relationships and students’ externalizing behaviors. Children's emotion expressivity and EC were related to engagement and relationships with teachers as well as behavioral problems at school. Children low in EC may be particularly vulnerable to the poor outcomes associated with relatively intense emotion expressivity as they struggle to manage their emotions and behaviors in the classroom.},

In a 3rd study, persons with neuromuscular disease were randomly assigned to either the gratitude condition or to a control condition. The gratitude-outlook groups exhibited heightened well-being across several, though not all, of the outcome measures across the 3 studies, relative to the comparison groups.

Forty-four internists were randomized to one of three groups; a control group, an affect-induction group, in which they received a small package of candy, or a group that was asked to read humanistic statements regarding the practice of medicine. Physicians “thought aloud” while they solved a case of a patient with liver disease. Two raters reviewed the tran- scripts to determine how soon the liver disease domain was considered, or at what point it was established, and the degree of anchoring displayed (distortion or inflexibility in thinking). The Affect group initially considered the diagnosis of liver disease significantly earlier in the protocol (20 vs 39\%, or 19\% earlier; 95\% confidence interval; 6 to 32\%, p = .008) and showed significantly less anchoring than did controls (means of 1.5 vs 3.9, or a difference of 2.4 in a scale of 1 to 10; 95\% confidence interval; 0.3 to 4.5, p = .031). The Affect and Control groups established the diagnosis at similar points in the protocol. Ancillary analyses examined questions relevant to the amounts of heuristic processing, premature closure, jumping to a diagnosis without sufficient evidence, or other evidence of superficial or flawed processing. No other differences were found. Physicians in whom positive affect had been induced integrated information earlier (considered liver) and demonstrated less anchoring, but did not show evidence of premature closure or other superficial pro- cessing.},

  abstract = {Background: During secondary education, a stage with a high risk of failure and school dropout, social support is an important contextual variable for the prevention of school maladjustment. The aim of this study is to examine a theoretical model of the explanatory capacity of social support in terms of school adjustment, understood as school engagement and perceived academic performance. Method: Participants were 1,468 students (51\% girls; 49\% boys) from the Basque Country, aged between 12 and 17 (M=14.03, SD=1.36). The study had an ex post facto cross-sectional design. The measurement instruments used were: TCMS –teacher support subscale, AFA-R –family support and peer support subscales, SEM –School Engagement Measure, and EBAE-10 - perceived academic performance subscale. Various different structural models were tested. Results: The first-choice model was one in which social support predicts school engagement with perceived academic performance as a mediating variable: together, both variables predict 73\% of school engagement. The strongest effect was that of teacher support, followed by family support, whereas friends were not found to have any direct effect on school adjustment variables. Conclusions: Teachers and families should strive to offer social support to students as a means of strengthening perceived academic self-efficacy and school engagement.},

In the 1st study, 2 of 3 pilot programs produced statistically significant happiness boosts compared to a placebo control. A single program was then designed that combined the best aspects of the pilot programs. In the 2nd study, an experimental group receiving this combined program showed significant boosts in happiness compared to a placebo control. In the 3rd study, the combined program was presented to Ss on a take-it-or-leave-it basis—those applying it showing significant boosts in happiness compared to those who did not. The studies suggest that the resulting self-study program may be helpful to individuals wishing to increase the emotional satisfaction they derive from living.

  abstract = {The broaden-and-build theory describes the form and function of a subset of positive emotions, including joy, interest, contentment and love. A key proposition is that these positive emotions broaden an individual's momentary thought-action repertoire: joy sparks the urge to play, interest sparks the urge to explore, contentment sparks the urge to savour and integrate, and love sparks a recurring cycle of each of these urges within safe, close relationships. The broadened mindsets arising from these positive emotions are contrasted to the narrowed mindsets sparked by many negative emotions (i.e. specific action tendencies, such as attack or flee). A second key proposition concerns the consequences of these broadened mindsets: by broadening an individual's momentary thought-action repertoire--whether through play, exploration or similar activities--positive emotions promote discovery of novel and creative actions, ideas and social bonds, which in turn build that individual's personal resources; ranging from physical and intellectual resources, to social and psychological resources. Importantly, these resources function as reserves that can be drawn on later to improve the odds of successful coping and survival. This chapter reviews the latest empirical evidence supporting the broaden-and-build theory and draws out implications the theory holds for optimizing health and well-being.},

Although centered on evidence that has emerged from Fredrickson's Positive Emotions and Psychophysiology Laboratory (PEP Lab), it features key findings from other laboratories as well. It begins with a description of 10 representative positive emotions, alongside approaches for assessing them, both directly with the modified Differential Emotions Scale and indirectly through physiological and implicit measures. Next, it offers the seeds of the broaden-and-build theory, including work on the undo effect of positive emotions. It then reviews the state of the evidence for the twin hypotheses that stem from the broaden-and-build theory, the broaden hypothesis and the build hypothesis, including a focus on upward spiral dynamics. It touches next on new frontiers for the theory, including deeper investigations into the biological resources that positive emotions build as well as clinical and organizational applications. Finally, this contribution closes with a brief presentation of two offshoots from the broaden-and-build theory, namely, the upward spiral model of lifestyle change and work on love as positivity resonance between and among people. Both are targets of increasing work in the PEP Lab. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6\% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes--although the greatest effects are in small (n [≤] 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

Fuchs et al., 2003), on 3rd-graders’ mathematical problem solving. SRL incorporated goal setting and self-evaluation. Problem-solving transfer instruction taught problem–solution methods, the meaning of transfer, and 4 superficial-problem features that change a problem without altering its type or solution; it also prompted metacognitive awareness to transfer. The authors contrasted the effectiveness of transfer plus SRL to the transfer treatment alone and to teacher-designed instruction. Twenty-four 3rd-grade teachers, with 395 students, were assigned randomly to conditions. Treatments were conducted for 16 weeks. Students were pre- and posttested on problem- solving tests and responded to a posttreatment questionnaire tapping self-regulation processes. SRL positively affected performance.},

A total of 622 adults subjected themselves to one of the nine interventions or to a placebo control exercise (early memories) and thereafter estimated their degrees of happiness and depression at five times (pre- and post-test, 1-, 3-, and 6 months follow-up). Eight of the nine interventions increased happiness; depression was decreased in all groups, including the placebo control group. We conclude that happiness can be enhanced through some “strengths-based” interventions. Possible mechanisms for the effectiveness of the interventions are discussed.},

Yet, traditionally mindfulness was not intended to operate in a vacuum of dispassionate observation, but was seen as facilitative of eudaimonic mental states. In spite of this historical context, modern psychological research has neglected to ask the question of how the practice of mindfulness affects downstream emotion regulatory processes to impact the sense of meaning in life. To fill this lacuna, here we describe the mindfulness-to-meaning theory, from which we derive a novel process model of mindful positive emotion regulation informed by affective science, in which mindfulness is proposed to introduce flexibility in the generation of cognitive appraisals by enhancing interoceptive attention, thereby expanding the scope of cognition to facilitate reappraisal of adversity and savoring of positive experience. This process is proposed to culminate in a deepened capacity for},

How individuals experience and deal with their emotions can be considered a key factor for various aspects of our mental health and well-being. Emotional awareness – a core element of emotional competence in children – refers to “individual differences in the way people differentiate, express, analyze, and pay attention to their own and others’ emotions” (Lahaye et al., 2011, p. 418). Interestingly, most of the studies addressing emotional awareness and anxiety, did not take into account that both concepts can be considered as multi-facetted phenomena. Therefore, the goal of this study was to examine the associations between different facets of emotional awareness. Results indicated that Verbal sharing of emotions seems to one of the key emotional competences that is linked to lower levels of multiple symptoms related to anxiety: in multiple regression analyses, this subscale of the EAQ predicted all facets of the MASC as well as avoidance of aversive situations related to school (Harm avoidance of the SRAS). This highlights the importance of expressing emotions and suggests that supporting children to learn how to share their emotions may lead to lower levels of many anxiety symptoms.},

Dans le but d’explorer les relations entre différentes facettes de la conscience émotionnelle et de l'anxiété, huit classes d’élèves (N = 158 ; M-âge = 11.4 ans [±0.68], 46.8\% de filles) ont rempli le Emotion Awareness Questionnaire revised (EAQ-30) (Lahaye et al., 2011) – permettant d’évaluer six facettes de la conscience émotionnelle – et les échelles d’anxiété Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) (Turgeon et al., 2006) et Test Anxiety Scale (TAS, Gomez \& Gay, 2017). Les analyses de régression multiple incluant l’âge, le genre, les notes moyennes des élèves et les six dimensions du EAQ comme variables indépendantes ont principalement fait ressortir que 1)	Différencier les émotions prédisait des difficultés cognitives (TAS) (β=-.403) et différents symptômes somatiques (TAS et MASC), ce qui suggère que développer cette compétence émotionnelle pourrait réduire le stress lié aux examens. Il s’agirait donc d’apprendre aux élèves à différencier diverses émotions et à localiser leurs antécédents, en particulier chez les enfants en difficulté scolaire. Dans cette optique, même un bref entraînement à la compréhension des émotions s’avère efficace (Sprung et al., 2015). 2)	Partager ses émotions prédisait l’anxiété sociale (MASC) (β=-.386) et différentes formes d’évitement, ce qui souligne l'importance d'exprimer des émotions et suggère qu’aider les enfants à apprendre à partager leurs émotions pourrait réduire de nombreux symptômes anxieux ; 3)	Enfin, la conscience corporelle prédisait l’anxiété de séparation (MASC) (β=287) et différents symptômes somatiques (MASC et TAS). Des interventions basées sur la pleine conscience présenteraient donc un intérêt particulier pour favoriser une conscience émotionnelle adaptative (Zoogman, Goldberg, Hoyt, \& Miller, 2015).},

Cela fait d’ailleurs plus d’une dizaine d’année que les recherches en psychologie positive s’intéressent à reconnaitre les ressources énergisantes des individus plutôt que leurs faiblesses, les utiliser davantage dans le quotidien et en classe. A ce propos, Peterson et Seligman (2004) ont développé une taxonomie de 24 forces personnelles (p.ex., patience, persévérance, collaboration, gentillesse) qui jouent un rôle important dans le développement du bien-être individuel et le fonctionnement optimal de chacun.  Dans ce contexte, l’objectif de cette recherche était d’évaluer les impacts d’une séquence pédagogique (compatible avec le plan d’études romand) visant à favoriser l’identification de la diversité des ressources individuelles en travaillant à partir des forces de caractères (Linkins, Niemiec, Gillham, \& Mayerson, 2015).  Une intervention de type pré-test post-test dans un échantillon de 96 élèves (7 à 12 ans) a permis de révéler que ce bref programme (4 séances sur une semaine) était efficace pour améliorer significativement l’estime de soi chez des élèves de 11-12 ans en comparaison avec une classe témoin. L’intervention montre également un certain effet sur le bien-être dans tous les groupes expérimentaux.  Cet outil prometteur pourrait s’avérer particulièrement intéressant en allongeant le temps passé à travailler sur ces éléments de psychologie positive et en ajoutant d’autres étapes qui ont déjà fait leurs preuves pour améliorer la cohésion du groupe classe en lien avec les forces de caractère : travailler sur l’utilisation des forces et sur la reconnaissance des forces des pairs.},

  abstract = {Enseigner appelle des pratiques pouvant s’appuyer sur des recherches empiriques et théories solides (pour une revue, voir p. ex. Weinstein, Madan, \& Sumeracki, 2018). Dans ce contexte, cette communication débutera par une présentation de quelques caractéristiques essentielles des mécanismes nécessaires à l’apprentissage, à savoir l’attention et la mémoire.  La sélectivité de l’attention sera d’abord présentée à travers quelques modèles cognitifs et l’auditoire sera testé afin de montrer son fonctionnement et ses limites. Dans un deuxième temps, c’est le fonctionnement de la mémoire et un modèle de ses différents systèmes qui seront abordés. Des résultats probants dans le domaine seront présentés, notamment pour montrer l’importance de se tester qui est très bien démontrée pour permettre un meilleur apprentissage sur le long terme (voir p. ex., Rowland, 2014 pour une méta-analyse). Par exemple, dans une des nombreuses recherches réalisées dans ce domaine, Zaromb, et Roediger (2010) ont demandé à trois groupes de travailler durant huit périodes pour apprendre des listes de mots. Un groupe devait alterner des phases d’étude et de tests, un autre groupe avait uniquement deux périodes de tests, et un troisième groupe ne faisait que d’étudier. Après deux jours, le groupe qui avait alterné des phases d’études et de test obtenait des performances plus de deux fois meilleures que le groupe qui avait enchainé huit périodes d’étude.  Ces résultats pour différents types de matériel à apprendre s’expliquent notamment par le fait que – en comparaison avec l’étude (p. ex., relire un cours, écouter une conférence) – les tests (p.ex., QCM, rappel libre) demandent plus d’engagement et d’effort. Par ailleurs, étudier ne fait qu’appel à de l’encodage (acquérir des informations) alors que se tester permet également d’entrainer la récupération (aller chercher des informations en mémoire à long terme), le mécanisme qui est d’ailleurs utilisé lors d’un examen. Pour apprendre à apprendre, il peut être suggéré par exemple, avant de relire un cours, de noter déjà tout ce qui revient, puis vérifier ce qui est correct ou non et identifier ce qui manque. La communication s’attardera à proposer des exploitations pédagogiques de ces résultats de psychologie cognitive et de neurosciences, tout en veillant à analyser les limites de cette démarche applicative. Notamment (1) l’importance d’un encodage profond et élaboré, (2) la supériorité de l’apprentissage distribué en comparaison avec l’apprentissage massif, (3) la supériorité de l’apprentissage entrelacé en comparaison avec l’apprentissage en bloc (Weinstein et al., 2018) seront par exemple des supports à l’identification de pratiques d’enseignement à privilégier, tout comme en quoi les émotions peuvent être des freins et des leviers dans l’apprentissage (Gay \& Shankland, 2019).},

Strengths interventions aim to promote well-being or other positive outcomes by facilitating strengths identification, and sometimes also strengths use and/or development. The present review provides an overview of the different strengths interventions that are investigated, their effectiveness, and moderating and mediating factors. Results of the 18 (quasi-)experimental studies that were identified through a systematic literature search showed that all types of strengths interventions had positive outcomes in terms of well-being, job outcomes (e.g. work engagement), personal growth initiative, and group or team outcomes (e.g. class cohesion). Hope, positive affect, authentic self- expression, perceptions of the employment relationship, and feelings of social worth were identified as mediators, whereas extraversion and having specific strengths (e.g. persistence) were identified as moderators. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for future research and practice.},

Multilevel exploratory factor analysis revealed that the eight teaching characteristics (understandability, illustration, enthusiasm, fostering attention, lack of clarity, difficulty, pace, level of expectation) represented two factors, labeled supportive presentation style (e.g., comprising understandability) and excessive lesson demands (e.g., comprising difficulty). In line with our hypothesis, we found clear relations on the intraindividual level between the two factors of teaching characteristics and students' academic emotions in the classroom (e.g., supportive presentation style positively related to students' enjoyment and negatively related to their boredom). Further, and supporting the universality assumption of teaching characteristics/academic emotions relations, the strength of relations between the two factors of teaching characteristics and academic emotions was very similar across the four academic domains. Implications for future research and educational practice are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The P value is a measure of statistical evidence that appears in virtually all medical research papers. Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value's inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so-and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

The difference in score growth in the online versus offline conditions is especially large for students with learning disabilities (LDs): Only in the online progress monitoring condition do LD students experience a statistically significant score increase. In addition, students with LDs report being substantially more engaged by (and with) Strategic Reader, finding many aspects of the tool differentially more helpful than their general education peers. In sum, the results provide promising paths for both curricular design and further research in the design of digital environments.},

Results document extraordinary growth in the last decade and confirm that scholars in this area have devoted the lion’s share of their attention to two of the three ‘Pillars’ of PP as proposed by Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi (2000): (1) the study of positive subjective experience and (2) positive personal traits. While interest in positive institutions has been somewhat sparse, there has been increased concern with the topics of ‘resilience’ and eudaimonia (broadly defined). The latter developments help to dispel the myth that PP is an elite endeavour solely concerned with Pollyanna-style ‘happiology’ in people who find themselves in idyllic circumstances. Hopefully the results of our content analysis of the field will encourage instructors who teach PP to provide their students with a well-balanced curriculum, one that accurately reflects the heterogeneity of the field, and one that mirrors recent scholarly trends.},

Visible Learning and the Science of Learning explains the major principles and strategies of learning, outlining why it can be so hard sometimes, and yet easy on other occasions. Aimed at teachers and students, it is written in an accessible and engaging style and can be read cover to cover, or used on a chapter-by-chapter basis for essay writing or staff development.

Visible Learning and the Science of Learning explains the major principles and strategies of learning, outlining why it can be so hard sometimes, and yet easy on other occasions. Aimed at teachers and students, it is written in an accessible and engaging style and can be read cover to cover, or used on a chapter-by-chapter basis for essay writing or staff development.

  abstract = {The purpose of this article is to explore a model of learning that proposes that various learning strategies are powerful at certain stages in the learning cycle. The model describes three inputs and outcomes (skill, will and thrill), success criteria, three phases of learning (surface, deep and transfer) and an acquiring and consolidation phase within each of the surface and deep phases. A synthesis of 228 meta-analyses led to the identification of the most effective strategies. The results indicate that there is a subset of strategies that are effective, but this effectiveness depends on the phase of the model in which they are implemented. Further, it is best not to run separate sessions on learning strategies but to embed the various strategies within the content of the subject, to be clearer about developing both surface and deep learning, and promoting their associated optimal strategies and to teach the skills of transfer of learning. The article concludes with a discussion of questions raised by the model that need further research.},

ACT is unusual in that it is linked to a comprehensive active basic research program on the nature of human language and cognition (Relational Frame Theory), echoing back to an earlier era of behavior therapy in which clinical treatments were consciously based on basic behavioral principles. The evidence from correlational, component, process of change, and outcome comparisons relevant to the model are broadly supportive, but the literature is not mature and many questions have not yet been examined. What evidence is available suggests that ACT works through different processes than active treatment comparisons, including traditional Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT). There are not enough well-controlled studies to conclude that ACT is generally more effective than other active treatments across the range of problems examined, but so far the data are promising.},

  abstract = {This study evaluated direct relations of both kindergarteners’ (N = 301) naturalistically observed emotion in 2 different school contexts and early kindergarten verbal competence to academic adjustment (i.e., standardized measures of academic achievement, teacher-reported academic skills, teacher-reported and observed school engagement) and if these relations were mediated by teacher-reported conflict with students and by peer acceptance. When controlling for verbal competence, positive emotions expressed in the classroom context positively directly predicted academic skills, whereas positive emotions expressed outside class (lunch/recess) negatively predicted academic skills. Negative emotions observed in the classroom context and during lunch/recess negatively predicted academic achievement. Positive emotions observed in both contexts indirectly predicted higher school engagement through its positive relation to peer acceptance; positive emotions expressed in lunch and recess indirectly predicted higher school engagement via lower teacher–student conflict. Negative emotions observed in both contexts also indirectly predicted lower school engagement via higher teacher–student conflict. Furthermore, verbal competence indirectly predicted higher academic adjustment via lower teacher–student conflict. Moreover, verbal competence moderated the association between peer acceptance (but not teacher–student conflict) and academic adjustment. Because verbal competence moderated the associations from peer competence, positive emotions in both contexts indirectly predicted higher academic adjustment via higher peer acceptance primarily for children with low, but not high, initial verbal competence.

Parents, teachers, and observers reported on children's effortful control, and teachers reported on their perceived levels of closeness and conflict with students. Students completed the passage comprehension and applied problems subtests of the Woodcock???Johnson tests of achievement, as well as a behavioral measure of effortful control. Analytical models predicting academic achievement were estimated using a structural equation model framework. Effortful control positively predicted academic achievement even when controlling for prior achievement and other covariates. Mediation hypotheses were tested in a separate model; effortful control positively predicted teacher???student closeness and strongly, negatively predicted teacher???student conflict. Teacher???student closeness and effortful control, but not teacher???student conflict, had small, positive associations with academic achievement. Effortful control also indirectly predicted higher academic achievement through its positive effect on teacher???student closeness and via its positive relation to early academic achievement. The findings suggest that teacher???student closeness is one mechanism by which effortful control is associated with academic achievement. Effortful control was also a consistent predictor of academic achievement, beyond prior achievement levels and controlling for teacher???student closeness and conflict, with implications for intervention programs on fostering regulation and achievement concurrently.},

  abstract = {Cultivating Awareness and Resilience in Education (CARE for Teachers) is a mindfulness-based professional development program designed to reduce stress and improve teachers’ performance and classroom learning environments. A randomized controlled trial examined program efficacy and acceptability among a sample of 50 teachers randomly assigned to CARE or waitlist control condition. Participants completed a battery of self-report measures at pre- and postintervention to assess the impact of the CARE program on general well-being, efficacy, burnout/time pressure, and mindfulness. Participants in the CARE group completed an evaluation of the program after completing the intervention. ANCOVAs were computed between the CARE group and control group for each outcome, and the pretest scores served as a covariate. Participation in the CARE program resulted in significant improvements in teacher wellbeing, efficacy, burnout/time-related stress, and mindfulness compared with controls. Evaluation data showed that teachers viewed CARE as a feasible, acceptable, and effective method for reducing stress and improving performance. Results suggest that the CARE program has promise to support teachers working in challenging settings and consequently improve classroom environments.}

  abstract = {Objectives. We examined whether kindergarten teachers' ratings of children’s prosocial skills, an indicator of noncognitive ability at school entry, predict key adolescent and adult outcomes. Our goal was to determine unique associations over and above other important child, family, and contextual characteristics. Methods. Data came from the Fast Track study of low–socioeconomic status neighborhoods in 3 cities and 1 rural setting. We assessed associations between measured outcomes in kindergarten and outcomes 13 to 19 years later (1991–2000). Models included numerous control variables representing characteristics of the child, family, and context, enabling us to explore the unique contributions among predictors. Results. We found statistically significant associations between measured social-emotional skills in kindergarten and key young adult outcomes across multiple domains of education, employment, criminal activity, substance use, and mental health. Conclusions. A kindergarten measure of social-emotional skills may be useful for assessing whether children are at risk for deficits in noncognitive skills later in life and, thus, help identify those in need of early intervention. These results demonstrate the relevance of noncognitive skills in development for personal and public health outcomes. (Am J Public Health.

For instance, in measures of implicit attitudes, participants are primed with pictures of specific African American and White stimulus persons sampled in some way from possible stimuli that might have been used. Yet seldom is the sampling of stimuli taken into account in the analysis of the resulting data, in spite of numerous warnings about the perils of ignoring stimulus variation (Clark, 1973; Kenny, 1985; Wells \& Windschitl, 1999). Part of this failure to attend to stimulus variation is due to the demands imposed by traditional analysis of variance procedures for the analysis of data when both participants and stimuli are treated as random factors. In this article, we present a comprehensive solution using mixed models for the analysis of data with crossed random factors (e.g., participants and stimuli). We show the substantial biases inherent in analyses that ignore one or the other of the random factors, and we illustrate the substantial advantages of the mixed models approach with both hypothetical and actual, well-known data sets in social psychology (Bem, 2011; Blair, Chapleau, \& Judd, 2005; Correll, Park, Judd, \& Wittenbrink, 2002).},

We created CAPs using a combination of evidencebased practices for vocabulary instruction, UDL, and Mayer’s instructional design principles. High school students with and without learning disabilities completed weekly curriculum-based measurement (CBM) probes (vocabulary matching) over an 8-week period along with two corresponding posttests. Students were nested within sections of world history and randomly assigned to alternating treatments (CAPs and business as usual) that were administered sequentially to each group. Results revealed that students with and without disabilities made significant growth on CBMs and scored significantly higher on the posttests when taught using CAPs.},

RESULTS Population prevalence of any of 3 mental disorders and levels of mental health appeared stable but were dynamic at the individual level. Fifty-two percent of the 17.5\% of respondents with any mental illness in 2005 were new cases; one half of those languishing in 1995 improved in 2005, and one half of those flourishing in 1995 declined in 2005. Change in mental health was strongly predictive of prevalence and incidence (operationalized as a new, not necessarily a first, episode) of mental illness in 2005.

However, these scientific constructs are distinct and may play complementary roles when predicting day-to-day positive emotions. Therefore, we examined the unique and interactive roles of dispositional mindfulness and perceived ability to savor the moment for predicting daily positive emotions as well as related psychological health benefits. Participants completed a 9-week longitudinal field study. At baseline, dispositional mindfulness and perceived ability to savor the moment were assessed, along with three indicators of psychological health: depressive symptoms, psychological well-being, and life satisfaction. Each day for the subsequent 9 weeks, participants reported on their emotions. At the end of the study, participants again completed the three psychological health measures. Results showed that baseline dispositional mindfulness and perceived ability to savor the moment interacted to predict mean positive emotion levels over the reporting period and, in turn, residualized changes in psychological health. Specifically, the relation between perceived ability to savor the moment and positive emotions and, in turn, residualized change in psychological health indicators was amplified at greater levels of mindfulness and fell to non-significance at lower levels of mindfulness. Dispositional mindfulness only predicted positive emotions and, in turn, residualized changes in psychological health, for those very high in perceived ability to savor the moment. This research provides preliminary evidence that dispositional mindfulness and perceived ability to savor the moment, though related constructs, may serve unique and synergistic roles in predicting benefits for and through positive emotions.},

The attainment of a workplace with high-caliber employees starts with the selection of the right people for the right jobs. Numerous studies have documented the utility of valid selection instruments and systems in the selection of the right people (Hunter \& Schmidt, 1983; Huselid, 1995; Schmidt, Hunter, McKenzie, \& Muldrow, 1979; Schmidt \& Rader, 1999). After employees have been selected, they make decisions and take actions every day that impact the success of their organizations. Many of these decisions and actions are influenced by their own internal motivations and drives. One can also hypothesize that the way employees are treated and the way they treat one another can positively affect their actions or can place their organizations at risk. For example, researchers have found positive relationships between general workplace attitudes and service intentions, customer perceptions (Schmit \& Allscheid, 1995), and individual performance outcomes (Iaffaldano \& Muchinsky, 1985). An updated meta- analysis has revealed a substantial relationship between individual job satisfaction and individual performance (Judge, Thoresen, Bono, \& Patton, 2001). Questions about the direction of causality in relationships between job satisfaction and performance have not been completely resolved, however. To date, the vast majority of job satisfaction research and subsequent meta-analyses have collected and studied data at the individual employee level.},

Academic articles and professional reports alluding to psychological models of the etiology of mental disorder are becoming increasingly common, and there is evidence of a marked policy shift toward the provision of psychological therapies and interventions. This article discusses the relationship between biological, social, and psychological factors in the causation and treatment of mental disorder. It argues that simple biological reductionism is not scientifically justified, and also that the specific role of psychological processes within the biopsychosocial model requires further elaboration. The biopsychosocial model is usually interpreted as implying that biological, psychological, and social factors are co-equal partners in the etiology of mental disorder. The psychological model of mental disorder presented here suggests that disruption or dysfunction in psychological processes is a final common pathway in the development of mental disorder. These processes include, but are not limited to, cognitive processes. The model proposes that biological and social factors, together with a person's individual experiences, lead to mental disorder through their conjoint effects on those psychological processes. Implications for research, interventions, and policy are discussed.},

This mediating psychological processes model proposes that biological and environmental factors, together with a persons personal experiences, lead to mental disorder through their conjoint effects on these psychological processes.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Despite widespread acceptance of the 'biopsychosocial model', the aetiology of mental health problems has provoked debate amongst researchers and practitioners for decades. The role of psychological factors in the development of mental health problems remains particularly contentious, and to date there has not been a large enough dataset to conduct the necessary multivariate analysis of whether psychological factors influence, or are influenced by, mental health. This study reports on the first empirical, multivariate, test of the relationships between the key elements of the biospychosocial model of mental ill-health. METHODS AND FINDINGS Participants were 32,827 (age 18-85 years) self-selected respondents from the general population who completed an open-access online battery of questionnaires hosted by the BBC. An initial confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the adequacy of the proposed factor structure and the relationships between latent and measured variables. The predictive path model was then tested whereby the latent variables of psychological processes were positioned as mediating between the causal latent variables (biological, social and circumstantial) and the outcome latent variables of mental health problems and well-being. This revealed an excellent fit to the data, S-B χ(2) (3199, N = 23,397) = 126654.8, p{$<$}.001; RCFI = .97; RMSEA = .04 (.038-.039). As hypothesised, a family history of mental health difficulties, social deprivation, and traumatic or abusive life-experiences all strongly predicted higher levels of anxiety and depression. However, these relationships were strongly mediated by psychological processes; specifically lack of adaptive coping, rumination and self-blame. CONCLUSION These results support a significant revision of the biopsychosocial model, as psychological processes determine the causal impact of biological, social, and circumstantial risk factors on mental health. This has clear implications for policy, education and clinical practice as psychological processes such as rumination and self-blame are amenable to evidence-based psychological therapies.},

Though these instructional effects also influence the efficiency and effectiveness of collaborative learning, be it computer supported or face-to-face, they are often not considered either when designing collaborative learning situations/environments or researching collaborative learning. One reason for this omission is that cognitive load theory has only sporadically concerned itself with certain particulars of collaborative learning such as the concept of a collective working memory when collaborating along with issues associated with transactive activities and their concomitant costs which are inherent to collaboration. We illustrate how and why cognitive load theory, by adding these concepts, can throw light on collaborative learning and generate principles specific to the design and study of collaborative learning.},

The grade 1 measures included sociometric peer assessment and teachers' self-ratings of their supportiveness in the classroom, together with information on class size and teaching experience. The results showed, first, that the studied social and learning risk factors positively predicted peer rejection in grade 1. Moreover, teacher-reported supportive classroom climate in grade 1 protected children against the detrimental impact of RD risk on peer rejection. Smaller class size, in turn, served as a protective factor against the detrimental impact of social withdrawal on peer rejection.

This review identifies rigorous studies of the effectiveness of formative assessment on elementary school student achievement. Results of the review indicate that: • Overall, formative assessment had a positive effect on student academic achievement. On average across the studies, students who participated in formative assessment performed better on measures of academic achievement than those who did not. • Formative assessment used during math instruction had larger effects, on average, than did formative assessment used during reading and writing instruction. • For math, both student-directed formative assessment and formative assessment directed by other agents, such as an educator or a computer program, were effective. • For reading, other-directed formative assessment was more effective than student-directed formative assessment.}

Moreover, previously suggested nonparametric analyses of multiple-baseline data can be subsumed by a general regulated randomization formula. The regulated randomization approach provides researchers with a flexible analytic tool that can take into account specific substantive, methodological, and statistical trade-offs.

Using cognitive evaluation theory, contrasting limit setting styles of either a controlling or informational nature, or no limits, were placed upon forty-four first- and second-grade children engaged in a painting activity. The intrinsic motivation, enjoyment, creativity, and quality of artistic production were expected to be decreased by controlling limits relative to informational and no-limits, which were not expected to differ from each other. The results provided substantial support for these predictions, suggesting that limits can be set without undermining intrinsic motivation if they are informational in nature. Support was also found for the consensual assessment of creativity method recently developed by Amabile (1982a).

The UDL framework provides guidelines for teachers when they create, instruct, and assess the delivery of content. Based on three underlying principles: multiple means of representation, action and expression, and engagement, UDL targets the needs of every learner in the classroom. Although much has been written about UDL in the K-12 classroom, the principles apply equally to higher education. Most faculty are well versed in the delivery of content through a traditional lecture format, yet few consider applying UDL principles. It is not enough that an instructor provide knowledge. He or she must also ensure that critical content is accessible to all students entering the university classroom. Faculty members recognized for their excellence in teaching include teaching strategies that are aligned to UDL principles. These strategies include creation of positive learning environments, use of humor, active engagement vs passive engagement, and explicit structure. The primary purpose of the article is threefold: to discuss the importance of using a UDL approach in higher education, to help faculty begin using a UDL approach through professional development, and sharing strategies for students in the higher education classroom. Recommendations are made for providing professional development to faculty to increase their use of universal design for learning principles with questions for consideration. Additional recommendations are made for teaching students through the UDL lens. By using a UDL framework, all students have access to curriculum in ways meaningful to each individual.},

Programs were coded for the presence/absence of four categories of strategies: focusing on the teacher, on student behavior, on students social-emotional development, and on teacher-student relationships. Focusing on the students social-emotional development appeared to have the largest contribution to the interventions effectiveness, in particular on the social-emotional outcomes.

In this critical review, I scrutinize positive education as a potential theory in educational psychology. Special attention is given to conceptual controversies and suggested educational interventions. Positive psychologists have yet to explore in detail the school as a positive institution. They have written at length, however, about such positive personal traits as moral virtue and resiliency, and about positive emotions both as embodied in experiences of classroom “flow” and as facilitators of students’ personal resources. Because the empirical evidence concerning these positive factors remains partly mixed or tentative, and because most of them had a home in other theoretical frameworks before the advent of positive psychology, searching questions remain about the effectiveness and originality of positive education. This article addresses some of those questions.},

Early in the book, the authors propose a model to aid in understanding the broad concept of savoring and, importantly, they offer several validated measures, with instructions for scoring. Through a combination of empirical research reports and vivid anecdotes, the authors establish savoring as both a means of enhancing everyday life and as an important field of inquiry that is only beginning to be understood. This book is a must-read for those in the field of positive psychology. As is often the case with a new field of research, the authors raise as many questions as they answer.

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

The present paper, based on educational, psychological, and organizational research, asserts that a discussion of character strengths and their development is highly relevant to this challenge. It provides an integrative overview of the relevance of character strengths to twenty-first-century schools and discusses different mechanisms that can help foster them. Character strengths-widely valued positive traits, theorized to be the basis for optimal functioning and well-being-may derive from inner tendencies, but are expected to have broad potential for development, depending on individuals' experiences and environments. Furthermore, character strengths are closely related to twenty-first-century compe-tencies-cognitive, interpersonal and intrapersonal competencies, identified by the American National Research Council as required for thriving in contemporary life and work, and thus considered to be desirable educational outcomes. The paper first delineates the connections between twenty-first-century competencies and character strengths, demonstrating the importance of promoting them in education. Then, mechanisms for fostering development of character strengths in schools are discussed, based on a review of the literature, including mechanisms that affect students (e.g., curriculum, relationships), teachers (e.g., training, supervisors), and schools (e.g., evaluation processes, resource allocation), while considering the interplay between these different levels. The concluding part of the paper outlines an integrative model of an optimal school system, expected to foster character strengths' use and development and discuss its applications for research and practice.},

In addition, we investigated whether associations between teaching practices and children's academic skills development in Grade 1 differed among children who had low, average, or high initial academic skills at the beginning of school. The reading and math skills of 1,132 Finnish children from 93 classrooms were assessed at the beginning and end of Grade 1, and the Early Childhood Classroom Observation Measure (ECCOM) was used to observe teaching practices in 29 classrooms. The results of multilevel modeling showed, first, that better reading skills upon entering school were associated with a higher level of child-centered teaching practices in the classroom. Second, a high level of child-centered teaching practices predicted children's reading and math skills development during the first school year. Third, the results showed that child-centered teaching practices were equally beneficial for the academic skills development of children with varying initial skill levels. However, teacher-directed practices were found to be negatively associated with reading skills development, particularly among children who had average or high initial reading skills at the beginning of school. The results emphasize the importance of child-centered teacher practices in promoting children's academic skills development also after kindergarten in elementary school.},

  abstract = {Positive psychology and coaching psychology share a number of common themes and fundamental assumptions. Blending positive psychology, strengths approaches and coaching psychology, our work in strengths coaching with leaders enhances both leadership and organisational capability. In this article, we explore the role of leaders as climate engineers and provide a brief history of strengths approaches, together with definitions of what we mean by strengths and strengths coaching, and how we use these in practice. We introduce the integrative Realise2 model of strengths and weaknesses which distinguishes between the six areas of realised strengths, unrealised strengths, regular learned behaviours, infrequent learned behaviours, exposed weaknesses, and unexposed weaknesses, before going on to demonstrate how leaders can make weaknesses irrelevant through role shaping complementary partnering, strengths-based team-working or personal development. We examine the golden mean of strengths use, looking at strengths both overplayed and underplayed, before concluding with a view on the benefits of strengths coaching for both leadership and organisational capability. The Appendix provides 10 summary points in a strengths coaching checklist for leaders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved) (from the journal abstract)},

Likewise, they identify pathways to the desired helper and muster the requisite energy to build a working alliance with their newfound agent of change. In essence, self-referred clients already have demonstrated hope in their pursuit of therapeutic support by the time they reach their therapist. In turn, therapists can help clients to name and to nurture the hope that they already possess. In this chapter, we identify formal strategies for accentuating the hope that people possess. We discuss the effectiveness data, where available, associated with these strategies. Given that most therapists are eclectic, we also describe informal strategies that could be implemented within any therapeutic framework; moreover, we address common strategies that can be assigned to clients as homework. We begin by outlining hope theory and discuss hope's role as an active ingredient in psychological change. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved).},

Pour surmonter ce conflit, l'élève doit inhiber la stratégie apprise antérieurement, devenue inefficace, au bénéfice d'une nouvelle stratégie pertinente. Certains blocages, erreurs ou difficultés des élèves nous ont incitées à transférer au monde de la classe des outils centrés sur l'apprentissage à l'inhibition, déjà éprouvés en laboratoire à l'aide de techniques comportementales et d'imagerie cérébrale. Ce projet a pris forme dans le cadre d'un partenariat scientifique entre l'Inspection Académique du Calvados (France) et le Laboratoire de Psychologie du Développement et de l'Éducation de l'enfant (LaPsyDÉ). Nous proposons une démarche pédagogique innovante d'apprentissage à l'inhibition réalisée en classe dans deux domaines scolaires différents (mathématiques et orthographe) avec des élèves de 6 à 11 ans. En partant d'erreurs récurrentes observées par les enseignants chez leurs élèves, nous avons élaboré un dispositif didactique expérimental d'apprentissage à l'inhibition dont nous avons testé l'efficacité. Les résultats de ces deux études mettent en évidence l'avantage d'un apprentissage à l'inhibition par rapport à un apprentissage classique. Ainsi, sensibiliser le terrain éducatif à l'importance du contrôle cognitif dans les apprentissages est fondamental pour permettre aux élèves d'apprendre à mieux apprendre.

Thus, the present study investigates Tthe impact of a short practise at the beginning of a lesson, two or three times a week. The results found here are encouraging: the students felt happier, more relaxed, more focused and more self-aware.  The fact that mindfulness influences subjective well-being and learning skills should trigger a greater implementation of mindfulness in schools. Thus, it could be brought through teacher education or through mindfulness professionals coming to schools. An easier way could be to use an app (Headspace, Petit Bambou, etc) or other mean, and have the students meditate.},

The authors suggest a conceptual model to account for these findings, arguing that the happiness-success link exists not only because success makes people happy, but also because positive affect engenders success. Three classes of evidence--crosssectional, longitudinal, and experimental--are documented to test their model. Relevant studies are described and their effect sizes combined meta-analytically. The results reveal that happiness is associated with and precedes numerous successful outcomes, as well as behaviors paralleling success. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that positive affect--the hallmark of well-being--may be the cause of many of the desirable characteristics, resources, and successes correlated with happiness. Limitations, empirical issues, and important future research questions are discussed.},

  abstract = {Objective: This pilot study examines the impact of an evidence-based strengths coaching programme on male primary school students' levels of engagement and hope. Design: In a within-subject design study, 38 Year Five male students (mean age 10.7 years) participated in a strengths-based coaching programme as part of their Personal Development/Health programme at an independent, private primary school in Sydney, Australia. Method: Participants were randomly allocated to groups of four or five with each group receiving eight coaching sessions over two school terms. The Youth Values in Action survey was used to highlight participant's character strengths, and the participants were coached in identifying personally meaningful goals, and in being persistent in their goal-striving, as well as finding novel ways to use their signature strengths. They also completed a 'Letter from the future' that involved writing about themselves at their best. Results: The strengths-based coaching pilot programme was associated with significant increases in the students' self-reported levels of engagement and hope. Conclusions: Strengths-based coaching programmes may be considered as potential mental health prevention and promotion intervention in a primary school setting to increase students' wellbeing and may also form an important part of an overall Positive Education Programme.

  title = {Que Penser… …de l'éducation Positive ?},
  author = {Maulini, Olivier},
  abstract = {2017 La série « Que penser… ? » s'adresse à des personnes intéressées par les questions pédagogiques hors du cercle des professionnels. Chaque thème est traité à l'occasion d'une demande formulée par un.e journaliste ou un autre relais d'opinion, et sous la forme d'un texte bref répondant à quelques questions clefs. L'intention de la série est de résumer les résultats de la recherche en conciliant complexité des enjeux et simplicité du propos. Éducation, pédagogie, psychologie, discipline, école positive : de quoi parlons-nous ? L'« éducation positive » désigne une manière particulière de penser et de pratiquer la formation d'autrui, en particulier lorsque le formateur est un adulte, et le formé un enfant. Les auteurs et les acteurs se réclamant de ce concept sont nombreux, ils peuvent varier dans leurs interprétations du modèle préconisé, mais tous partagent en général les postulats suivants : l'enfant apprend plus et mieux dans un environnement sécurisé, protecteur, bienveillant, lorsqu'il est confronté à des attentes élevées mais toujours soucieuses de « son bien » et des meilleures manières de l'y mener ; la pédagogie, la psychologie, la discipline ou encore l'école positive procèdent sans violence-ni physique, ni psychique-donc sans les mises en garde, les menaces, les reproches et les punitions (voire les châtiments) de la « pédagogie noire » à laquelle la psychanalyste Alice Miller fait remonter les maux de nos sociétés. À l'ère où les parents (voire les enseignants) peuvent tour à tour craindre les procès en abus de pouvoir (rigidité…) et en laxisme (permissivité…), la démarche positive (ou bienveillante, ou centrée sur les besoins) se profile comme un mélange idéal d'attention et de fermeté. Elle refuse à la fois le rapport de force et l'abus de complicité. De là découle sa préférence plus ou moins syncrétique pour le respect et le soin (contre la négligence et l'arrogance), pour la bientraitance (contre la brutalité), pour la gratitude et les félicitations (contre les reproches et les récriminations), pour la valorisation des compétences (contre la stigmatisation des faiblesses), pour le risque et l'erreur (contre la faute et la culpabilisation), pour la confiance et l'optimisme (contre le soupçon), pour la joie et l'estime de soi (contre la honte et la peur), pour la paix et la coopération (contre la concurrence et les agressions), pour la prise en compte des émotions (contre leur ignorance, voire leur refoulement), pour la nature humaine, la spontanéité et la créativité (contre les normes arbitraires et les routines codifiées). En somme, et en résumé, éduquer positivement consiste à valoriser les bonnes conduites plutôt qu'à dévaloriser les mauvaises : pas parce que le monde serait soudain devenu bon, mais parce que la quête libératrice des renforcements positifs (« Bravo ! ») serait plus efficace, à long terme, que la crainte aliénante des jugements négatifs (« Zéro ! »).}

In this study, we investigated the relationship between trait EI and four distinct socioemotional criteria on a sample of Dutch adolescents (N ¼ 282; 136 girls, 146 boys; mean age ¼ 13.75 years). As hypothesized, trait EI was positively associated with adaptive coping styles and negatively associated with depressive thoughts and frequency of somatic complaints. It was also negatively associated with maladaptive coping styles, in boys only. Adolescents with high trait EI scores received more nominations from their classmates for being co-operative and girls gave significantly more nominations to classmates with high trait EI scores for having leadership qualities. The discussion focusses on the operationalization of trait emotional self-efficacy in adolescents. The general concept of emotional intelligence (EI) is partly rooted in Thorndike's (1920) idea of 'social intelligence' and Gardner's (1983) theory of multiple intelligences (especially 'intrapersonal' and 'interpersonal' intelligence). In the current context, EI as a construct was discussed in a dissertation by Payne (1986), even though as a term it had appeared in the literature much earlier (Leuner, 1966). Salovey and Mayer (1990) put forward a theoretical model that viewed the construct as a subset of social intelligence and Goleman (1995) provided a broad and highly influential account that has nonetheless attracted concerted criticism for its unsubstantiated claims about the vital importance of EI in people's personal, social and professional lives. The fact that the field still lacks a universally accepted operational definition has contributed significantly to the emergence of inconsistent and sometimes, contradictory findings that have often been discussed in the scientific},

In this paper, we present a model of emotion that focuses on the notion of emotional components and the importance of the appraisal process in emotion. Then, we suggest that such a model constitutes a useful grid in order to analyse the emotional dynamic of the didactic situation and of the educational relationship. In particular, we support our reasoning with an example of critical importance in learning situations, namely the links between relevance and attention.},

  abstract = {The VIA Inventory of Strengths is an extremely popular index of the 24 character strengths that comprise the VIA Classification of Character Strengths and Virtues. The inventory has recently been extensively revised. The current study sought to evaluate the reliability and validity of the revised VIA Inventory, including newly developed short forms and scales measuring the virtue component of the VIA Classification. This study used two samples of adults, one comprised of 743 individuals recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), and another of 631 individuals who accessed the VIA Institute of Character website to complete an earlier version of the VIA Inventory. Participants completed the new version of the inventory as well as a measure of related behaviors. The current study examines internal consistency, factor structure, test-retest reliability, criterion-related validity, convergent and discriminant validity, and item discrimination statistics. The results suggest the inventory generally meets psychometric standards for a measure of the targeted character strengths and virtues.},

  abstract = {Personal growth initiative (PGI), defined as being proactive about one's personal development, is critical to graduate students' academic success. Prior research has shown that students' PGI can be enhanced through interventions that focus on stimulating developmental activities. Within this study, we aimed to investigate whether an intervention that stimulates development in the area of one's personal strengths (strengths intervention) has more beneficial effects on students' PGI than an intervention that stimulates development in the area of individual deficiencies (deficiency intervention). We conducted 2 longitudinal field experiments to investigate the effects of the 2 interventions on students' PGI (Experiment 1) and the potential mediating role of psychological capital (PsyCap) in this regard (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, 105 (N ϭ 105) university students participated in either a strengths intervention or a deficiency intervention. Results indicated that the strengths intervention increased the students' PGI in the short but not in the long term, whereas the deficiency intervention did not affect PGI. Ninety students (N ϭ 90) participated in Experiment 2, in which we slightly refined both interventions by putting a stronger emphasis on the ongoing development of strengths (strengths intervention) or correction of deficiencies (deficiency intervention) by adding posttraining assignments. Results suggested that participating in both interventions led to increases in PGI over a 3-month period, but that these increases were bigger for the strengths intervention group. Furthermore, the relationship between the strengths intervention and PGI was mediated by hope as one component of PsyCap. A positive and proactive stance toward change and continuous self-improvement, in other words personal growth initiative (PGI), is a critical resource for today's graduate students facilitating not only academic but also future career success. The critical role of PGI for students can be underpinned by three key arguments. First, research evidence corroborates that PGI favorably affects students' psychological, social, and emotional well-being while they are at the university (Robitschek \& Keyes, 2009), and triggers them to actively explore different career opportunities (Robitschek \& Cook, 1999). Second, scholars have reasoned that personal growth initiative facilitates the transition from university to employment because students with high levels of PGI are certain about their roles in life, know what their career goals are, and pin down action points that will help them reach their goals (Stevic \& Ward, 2008). Finally, personal growth initiative is said to help individuals to cope with the multitude of challenging situations requiring change and adaptation, which they will inevitably encounter throughout their careers (Robitschek, 1998; Robitschek et al., 2012). Results of prior research indicate that PGI of students can be enhanced through purposeful interventions, in particular, through interventions that stimulate personal growth (Thoen \& Robitschek, 2013). However, individuals can either grow by overcoming their deficiencies or by building up their strengths, and this differenti-ation has, to our knowledge, not been considered in prior research. We hypothesize that interventions that aim at building up strengths (strengths interventions) as well as interventions that aim at over-coming deficiencies (deficiency interventions) will have positive effects on the participants' PGI, but that these effects will be stronger for strengths interventions. The reason why we expect more pronounced effects for strengths interventions is that using strengths has theoretically been linked to intrinsic motivation and fast learning (Peterson \& Seligman, 2004), which, in combination, facilitate the intentional pursuit of growth activities. We further-more hypothesize that the positive effects of the strengths inter-vention on PGI will be mediated by psychological capital (PsyCap), a state-like higher-order construct encompassing self-efficacy, optimism, hope, and resilience (Luthans et al., 2007). Again, we expect stronger effects for the strengths intervention, because working on strengths enhances the participants' confi-dence, success expectations, perseverance, and the ability to cope with setbacks (Govindji \& Linley, 2007), which, in turn, trigger proactive behaviors with regard to one's personal growth (Ogun-yemi, 2007). To investigate our research hypotheses, we conducted two field experiments in which we compared the effects of a strengths and},

This article reports on innovations embedded within an ITE program to support trainee teachers to recognize and challenge the persistence of neuromyths. Education researchers, neuroscientists, and psychologists collaboratively applied design-based research to create, improve, and reflect on original neuroeducational teaching/learning resources for university-based primary (elementary) ITE trainees. Encouragingly, pre and postsurveys showed reductions in trainees' beliefs in neuromyths and a shift to responses showing uncertainty that suggested their beliefs became unsettled. The most persistent neuromyths were those regarding fish oils, left brain/right brain, and learning styles/visual, auditory, or kinaesthetic (VAK). Trainees retained their initial interest in knowledge about the brain and education, gained confidence, and became more critical about applying the learning sciences in educational contexts. The potential for educational neuroscience is being actively explored across the globe (Thomas, Ansari, \& Knowland, 2018). Over the past decade, there have been increasing calls for greater integration and collaboration between cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and teaching, but also a recognition that this is problematic and that deliberate bridging is required}

The results showed that study demands and a lack of study resources (including the intrinsic nature of study tasks, relationships with lecturers, and social support of peers) were positively associated with burnout. The availability of study resources was positively associated with psychological well-being and engagement. Burnout predicted psychological unwell-being symptoms, while engagement predicted satisfaction with life.

At specific time intervals during problem solving, students reported their epistemic and activity emotions. To capture self-regulatory processes, students thought out loud as they solved the problem. Path analyses revealed that both perceived control and value served as important antecedents to the epistemic and activity emotions students experienced during problem solving. Epistemic and activity emotions also predicted the types of processing strategies students used across three phases of self-regulated learning during problem solving. Finally, shallow and deep processing cognitive and metacognitive strategies positively predicted problem-solving performance. Theoretical and educational implications are discussed.},

The aim of this review was to systematically review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi experimental studies examining the impact of the strengths-based approach on level of functioning and quality of life as primary outcomes and psychotic symptoms as secondary outcomes in people diagnosed with severe mental illness.Methods: This review was conducted in the School of Health Sciences, University of Nottingham, United Kingdom. Participants in the primary studies were adults diagnosed with psychotic disorders. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed independently by two reviewers using " Consort 2010" checklist for the randomized controlled trials or " TREND" for the quasi-experimental studies. The EPOC checklist was used for data extraction while management of data and meta-analysis were performed using Review Manager software (RevMan version 5.2).Results: No significant difference was found between the strengths-based approach and other service delivery models in level of functioning and quality of life. However, a significant effect on symptoms favouring other service delivery models was reported.Conclusion: Based upon evidence of moderate quality, this review suggests there is no effect of the strengths-based model of service delivery in level of functioning and quality of life in adults diagnosed with severe mental illness. The number of trials is low; therefore further evidence is required to ascertain the impact of the strengths-based approach in community mental health care.},

  abstract = {Life is a collection of moments, some light and pleasant, some dark and unpleasant, some neutral. Character strengths contribute to the full range of human experiences, influencing and creating positive opportunities while also helping us to endure the mundane and embrace and navigate the struggles. Some researchers have argued that thriving, which casts a wider net on the human experience than constructs such as flourishing or resilience, constitutes strong well-being and performance at times of both adversity and opportunity (Brown et al. 2017). With this and the many findings in the science of character in mind, six character strengths functions are theorized and then applied across time orientations, making the case for the integral role of character strengths in these matters of thriving. Three opportunity functions are offered, including priming in which character strengths prompt and prepare for strengths awareness and use; mindfulness in which character strengths serve in synergy with mindful awareness of the present reality; and appreciation in which character strengths use expresses value for what has occurred. The three adversity functions include: buffering – character strengths use prevents problems; reappraisal – character strengths explain or reinterpret problems; and resilience – character strengths support the bounce-back from life setbacks. Several applications of these six functions for vocational and educational settings are explored.},

  abstract = {he increasing momentum of the Positive Psychology movement has seen burgeoning research in positive mental health and adaptive functioning; a critical question is how this knowledge can now be applied in real-world settings. Positive Education seeks to combine principles of Positive Psychology with best-practice teaching and with educational paradigms to promote optimal development and flourishing in the school setting. Interest in Positive Education continues to grow in line with increasing recognition of the important role played by schools in fostering wellbeing, and the link between wellbeing and academic success. To date, however, a framework to guide the implementation of Positive Education in schools has been lacking. This paper provides an overview of the Geelong Grammar School (GGS) Model for Positive Education, an applied framework developed over five years of implementing Positive Education as a whole-school approach in one Australian school. Explicit and implicit teaching in combination with school-wide practices target six wellbeing domains, including positive emotions, positive engagement, positive accomplishment, positive purpose, positive relationships, and positive health, underpinned by a focus on character strengths. The Model provides a structured pathway for implementing Positive Education in schools, a framework to guide evaluation and research, and a foundation for further theoretical discussion and development.},

In the current study, therefore, we used a propensity score analysis approach to evaluate whether students who were matched on their propensity to experience a given level of relationship quality but differed on their actual relationship quality diverged on their concurrent and subsequent problem and prosocial behavior. Student/self, teacher, and parent-(only waves 1–3) reported data from 8 waves of the Zurich Project on the Social Development of Children and Youths (z-proso), a longitudinal study of Swiss youth among a culturally diverse sample of 7-to 15-year-olds were uti-lized. The initial sample included 1483 (49.4 \% female) students for whom information relevant for this study was available. The sample represented families from around 80 different countries, from across all the continents; with approximately 42 \% of the female primary caregivers having been born in Switzerland. Following successful matching, we found that students who reported better relationships with their teachers and whose teachers reported better relationships with them evidenced fewer problem behaviors concurrently and up to 4 years later. There was also evidence for an analogous effect in pre-dicting prosocial behavior. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to prevention and inter-vention practices.},

A new 3 × 3 classification of PPIs was developed based on the processes and content of the PPI and the outcomes measured. This classification involves 9 different types of interventions depending on whether the intervention focuses on positive, remedial, or both positive and remedial processes and content, and whether the inter­ vention aims to evade or address challenges, deficits, or disorders or improve or elicit positive outcomes. Positive content-balanced outcomes interventions were the most common type used in schools (38\%) and clinical settings (63\%). Mindfulness was the most common approach used (49\% in schools and 71\% in clinical settings). Surprisingly, relatively few studies focused on wellestablished positive psychological constructs, such as strengths, hope, and gratitude. Overall, the results suggest strong support for the use of PPIs in school and clinical contexts.},

Here, we examined how prior exposure to negative emotional stimuli affects the response-stopping network. Participants performed the stop-signal task, which relies on inhibitory control processes, after they viewed blocks of either negatively emotional or neutral images. In Experiment 1, we found that neural activity was reduced following negative image viewing. When participants were required to inhibit responding after neutral image viewing, we observed activation consistent with previous studies using the stop-signal task. However, when participants were required to inhibit responding after negative image viewing, we observed reductions in the activation of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medial frontal cortex, and parietal cortex. Furthermore, analysis of neural connectivity during stop-signal task blocks indicated that across participants, emotion-induced changes in behavioral performance were associated with changes in functional connectivity, such that greater behavioral impairment after negative image viewing was associated with greater weakening of connectivity. In Experiment 2, we collected behavioral data from a larger sample of participants and found that stopping performance was impaired after negative image viewing, as seen in longer stop-signal reaction times. The present results demonstrate that negative emotional events can prospectively disrupt the neural network supporting response inhibition.},

In spite of their many functions, however, positive emotions have been neglected by psychology. Until recently, psychology has focused on the dark side of human life. Psycho- pathological behaviour, negative emotions emanating from stress, and coping with stress and negative emotions have been studied extensively, whereas adaptive behaviour, positive emotions, and proactive coping did not receive that much attention (cf. Frydenberg 1997; Fredrickson 2001). Furthermore, traditional theories addressing the functions of positive emotions for cognition and behaviour have focused on negative effects of positive emotions, instead of their regulatory benefits (cf.

The control-value theory provides a theoretical framework making it possible to integrate constructs and assumptions from a variety of theoretical approaches to emotions in education and to achievement emotions more generally. Empirically, many facets of the theory have consistently been corroborated in qualitative and quantitative investigations. However, the assumptions provided by the theory on how to design emotionally sound learning environments for students, and occupational environments for teachers, have yet to be tested in empirical intervention studies. There is evidence that educational interventions can reduce students' test anxiety. The control-value theory implies that shaping educational environments in adequate ways can help to change achievement emotions other than anxiety as well. Future research should systematically explore measures to help both students and teachers to develop adaptive achievement emotions, prevent maladaptive emotions, and use their emotions in productive and healthy ways. ?? 2007 Copyright ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Scale construction used a rational-empirical strategy based on Pekrun's (2006) control-value theory of achievement emotions and prior exploratory research. The instrument was tested in a study using a sample of university students (N=389). Findings indicate that the scales are reliable, internally valid as demonstrated by confirmatory factor analysis, and externally valid in terms of relationships with students' control-value appraisals, learning, and academic performance. The results provide further support for the control-value theory and help to elucidate the structure and role of emotions in educational settings. Directions for future research and implications for educational practice are discussed. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

We describe the construction and validation of the Epistemically-Related Emotion Scales, which measure surprise, curiosity, enjoyment, confusion, anxiety, frustration, and boredom occurring during epistemic cognitive activities. The instrument was tested in a multinational study of emotions during learning from conflicting texts (N = 438 university students from the United States, Canada, and Germany). The findings document the reliability, internal validity, and external validity of the instrument. A seven-factor model best fit the data, suggesting that epistemically-related emotions should be conceptualised in terms of discrete emotion categories, and the scales showed metric invariance across the North American and German samples. Furthermore, emotion scores changed over time as a function of conflicting task information and related significantly to perceived task value and use of cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies.},

  abstract = {Research on self-compassion, which is defined as being understanding and kind to oneself when confronted with negative experiences, has produced an impressive number of articles in recent years. This research shows that individual differences in self-compassion, as measured by the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), are positively related to life satisfaction, health and social functioning. However, a critical and systematic test of self-compassion from a personality perspective has not yet conducted so far. In the present study (N = 576), we (i) tested the factor structure of the SCS, (ii) examined the distinctiveness of self-compassion with regard to the five-factor model of personality, fo-cusing on neuroticism, and (iii) tested the incremental predictive power of self-compassion beyond the five-factor model in the context of life satisfaction. Confirmatory factor analyses supported a two-factor plus six facets solution of self-compassion (a positive factor and a negative factor). Additional analyses revealed that the negative factor was redundant with facets of neuroticism (rs ≥ .85), whereas the positive factor had some unique variance left. However, neither the negative factor nor the positive factor could explain substantial incremental variance in life satisfaction beyond neuroticism. Recommendations for how to use the SCS are provided, and the future of research on self-compassion is discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: After five decades of research, an initial consensus on a general taxonomy of personality traits, the "Big Five" personality dimensions, is nowadays largely accepted. These dimensions do not represent a particular theoretical perspective but were derived from factor analyses of the natural-language terms people use to describe themselves and others. The Big Five Inventory (BFI) does not use single adjectives as items because such items are answered less consistently than when they are accompanied by definitions or elaboration. It uses 44 short phrases based on the trait adjectives known to be prototypical markers of the Big Five. The Big Five have been most typically labeled E (Extraversion, Energy, Enthusiasm), A (Agreeableness, Altruism, Affection), C (Conscientiousness, Constraint, Control of impulse), N (Neuroticism, Negative affectivity, Nervousness), and O (Openness, Originality, Open-mindedness). The BFI has been translated and validated in different languages. The development was done in such a way that they resembled as closely as possible the original English version, both in psychological meanings and psychometric properties. Objectives: The goal of this paper is to present the validation process of the French BFI (BFI-Fr) on a large student sample to verify psychometric properties, including factor structure and internal reliability and to show that the scales possess the necessary convergent and discriminant validity with the NEO personality inventory, revised (NEO-PI-R). Study 1: Internal consistency and intercultural comparison. Materials and method: Two thousand four hundred and ninety-nine students were included (women 69\%; mean age 20.2 years old, S.D. = 2.21, between 15 and 46 years). The 45 items of the BFI-Fr were filled out anonymously by the students at the university. Results and discussion: A factorial analysis using principal components was performed on the student answers (raw data) and resulted in a five-factor varimax-rotated solution that was easily verified as the expected five dimensions E, A, C, N, and O, which explained 42\% of the total variance. Cronbach's alpha coefficients which measure the internal coherence were respectively: 0.82, 0.75, 0.80, 0.82, and 0.74. This factorial analysis represents a very good replication of the American BFI. The mean internal consistency (0.79) is excellent, providing clear evidence of the psychometric qualities of the tool (internal validity). Normality of the distribution factors was verified before comparing the scores of French students with those of American and Spanish students. Mean scores and standard deviations were very similar in the three countries. As in previous research, gender differences in personality were found: females had higher scores (p {$<$} 0.001) for N, A, and C. Study 2: convergent and discriminant validation with the NEO-PI-R. The goal of study 2 was to compare the BFI-Fr with the NEO-PI-R. Materials and method: Three hundred and sixty students (women 55\%, mean age 21.1 years, S.D. = 2.30, between 18.3 and 45.5) were included. In the same session, they completed both the BFI-Fr and the French NEO-PI-R. Results and discussion: Internal consistencies of the five personality dimensions were comparable for the BFI and the NEO-PI-R. Correlations between the corresponding pairs were all high (mean = 0.74) and significant (p {$<$} 0.001). These results provide evidence of the convergent validity of the BFI-Fr. Discriminant validity was excellent, with correlations between the other scales much lower than the convergent correlations, averaging only 0.14. General discussion and conclusion: All three studies demonstrate that the BFI-Fr is a valid, powerful yet very efficient tool, as are the original English version and the other translations. The much longer NEO-PI-R remains the instrument of choice. Psychiatrists, psychologists, and researchers can now make use of another inventory in French to measure the Big Five which has the advantages of being simple, robust, reliable, and economical (5 to 10 min to complete). © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

  abstract = {In the last 20 years, it has been established that children's understanding of emotion changes with age. A review of the extensive literature reveals at least nine distinct components of emotion understanding that have been studied (from the simple attribution of emotions on the basis of facial cues to the emotions involved in moral judgments). Despite this large corpus of findings, there has been little research in which children's understanding of all these various components has been simultaneously assessed. The goal of the current research was to examine the development of these nine components and their interrelationship. For this purpose, 100 children of 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 years were tested on all nine components. The results show that: (1) children display a clear improvement with age on each component; (2) three developmental phases may be identified, each characterized by the emergence of three of the nine components; (3) correlational relations exist among components within a given phase; and (4) hierarchical relations exist among components from successive phases. The results are discussed in terms of their theoretical and practical implications. Over the last two decades several cognitive-developmental laboratories have demonstrated important changes in children's understanding of emotion between the ages of 18 months and 12 years. These changes include children's developing understanding of the nature of emotions, their causes and the possibility of control (for recent reviews see Harris,},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen an increasing interest in research in positive psychology interventions. There is broad evidence for their effectiveness in increasing well-being and ameliorating depression. Intentional activities that focus on those character strengths, which are most typical for a person (i.e., signature strengths, SS) and encourage their usage in a new way have been identified as highly effective. The current study aims at comparing an intervention aimed at using SS with one on using individual low scoring (or lesser) strengths in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. A total of 375 adults were randomly assigned to one of the two intervention conditions [i.e., using five signature vs. five lesser strengths (LS) in a new way] or a placebo control condition (i.e., early memories). We measured happiness and depressive symptoms at five time points (i.e., pre- and post-test, 1-, 3-, and 6-months follow-ups) and character strengths at pre-test. The main findings are that (1) there were increases in happiness for up to 3 months and decreases in depressive symptoms in the short term in both intervention conditions; (2) participants found working with strengths equally rewarding (enjoyment and benefit) in both conditions; (3) those participants that reported generally higher levels of strengths benefitted more from working on LS rather than SS and those with comparatively lower levels of strengths tended to benefit more from working on SS; and (4) deviations from an average profile derived from a large sample of German-speakers completing the Values-in-Action Inventory of Strengths were associated with greater benefit from the interventions in the SS-condition. We conclude that working on character strengths is effective for increasing happiness and discuss how these interventions could be tailored to the individual for promoting their effectiveness.},

L’inclusion scolaire a pris son essor depuis la proclamation de la Déclaration de Salamanque (UNESCO, 1994), où pas moins de 92 pays et 25 organisations internationales se sont engagés pour la première fois à œuvrer pour le développement d’écoles plus inclusives. Plus de vingt ans après cette déclaration, alors que le nombre de systèmes scolaires inscrivant leur projet éducatif dans une visée inclusive augmente, le besoin de clarifier tant le concept d’inclusion que les conditions et les moyens de sa mise en œuvre s’impose, et ce, d’autant plus que certaines représentations de ce concept tendent à s’éloigner de son essence et de son but originel. Cet ouvrage rend compte des travaux effectués au sein du Laboratoire international de recherche sur l’inclusion scolaire [www.lisis.ca] et fournit une contribution attendue au sein de la communauté francophone. Il propose des textes fondamentaux dans lesquels les auteurs présentent une synthèse de ce qui caractérise chacun des thèmes centraux associés à l’édification de systèmes éducatifs plus inclusifs : les fondements (le pourquoi), les acteurs (le qui) et les pratiques (le comment). Considérant que l’inclusion scolaire dépasse largement l’enceinte de l’école et s’inscrit fondamentalement comme un projet de société, cette publication est susceptible d’éclairer quiconque s’intéresse à l’éducation comme une voie incontournable dans la construction d’un monde empreint de plus grande justice sociale et d’équité.},

Research examining individual factors, such as strengths use, psychological need satisfaction, goal-setting and goal-striving provides promising leads to explain how strengths interventions work. However, the effect on intervention efficacy of relational or contextual factors, such as intervention environment or facilitator attitude to strengths, has not yet been explored.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A pan-Canadian School Travel Planning intervention promoted active school travel (AST). A novel component was exploring emotion, well-being, and travel mode framed by the concept of "sustainable happiness." Relationships between travel mode and emotions, parent perceptions of their child's travel mode on well-being, and factors related to parent perceptions were examined.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Questionnaires were administered to families (N\,=\,5423) from 76 elementary schools. Explanatory variables were demographics (age and sex), school travel measures (mode, distance, accompaniment by an adult, safety, and barriers), and emotions (parent and child). Outcomes examined parent perceived benefits of travel mode on dimensions of well-being (physical, emotional, community, and environmental). Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests and hierarchical regression were used.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Parents and children who used AST reported more positive emotions versus passive travelers. Parents of active travelers reported stronger connections to dimensions of well-being. AST had the strongest association with parents' perceptions of their child's well-being, and positive emotions (parent and child) were also significantly related to well-being on the trip to school.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: As an additional potential benefit of AST, interventions should raise awareness of the positive emotional experiences for children and their parents. Future research should experimentally examine if AST causes these emotional benefits.},

  abstract = {Objective: This study assesses the reliability and validity of the European KIDSCREEN-52 generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire for children and adolescents. Research Design: The KIDSCREEN-52, which measures HRQoL in 10 dimensions, was administered to a represen- tative sample of 22,827 children and adolescents (8 to 18 years) in 13 European countries. Psychometric properties were assessed using the Classical Test Theory approach, Rasch analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM). A priori expected associations between KIDSCREEN scales and sociodemographic and health-related factors were examined. Test–retest reliability was assessed in 10 countries. Results: For the overall sample, Cronbach’s alpha values ranged from 0.77 to 0.89. Scaling success (Multitrait Analy- sis Program) was {$>$}97.8\% for all dimensions and Rasch analysis item fit (INFITmsq) ranged from 0.80 to 1.27. The intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.77. No sizeable differential item functioning (DIF) was found by age, sex or health status. Four items showed DIF across countries. The specified SEM fitted the data well (root mean square error of approximation: 0.06, comparative fit index: 0.98). Correlation coefficients between Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Child Health and Illness Profile-Adolescent Edition, and Youth Quality of Life Instrument scales and KIDSCREEN dimensions assessing similar constructs were moderate for those (r = 0.44 to 0.61). Statistically significant differences between children with and without physical and mental health problems (Children with Special Health Care Needs screener: d = 0.17 to 0.42, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire: d = 0.32 to 0.72) were found in all dimen- sions. All dimensions showed a gradient according to socio- economic status. Conclusions: The KIDSCREEN-52 questionnaire has acceptable levels of reliability and validity. Further work is needed to assess longitudinal validity and sensitivity to change.},

  abstract = {Visual distraction is widely studied in children, particularly in visuospatial cognitive tasks. In these studies, targets and distractors are usually shown in the same display (e.g., the computer screen). However, children are constantly exposed to visually enriched environments (e.g., elementary school classrooms), and little is known about their influence on children's cognition. Although the importance of the surrounding environment is well recognized in the literature, few experimental studies have explored this question. We propose an alternative paradigm to study visual distraction in children that brings together the rigor of experimental psychology and more ecological validity on the exposure to potential environmental distractors. Our study was designed to investigate whether a high-load versus low-load visual surrounding environment influences children's cognitive performance as evaluated by four different cognitive tasks. A sample of 64 children (aged 8–12 years) completed two sessions in two environmental conditions: a high-load visual surrounding environment and a low-load environment. In each session, they performed visuospatial attention and memory tasks. Overall, the results suggested that the high-load visual environment affected children's cognitive performance given that children performed better in the low-load visual environment (e.g., higher percentage of hits, higher Corsi span). Understanding the impact that a visually rich surrounding environment has on children's cognitive processes that support more complex ones is important to support recommendations on how the environment should be organized to foster better daily activities.},

A total of 209 children attending first grade were initially assessed in terms of their executive functioning and academic self-concept. One year later, children's executive functioning, academic self-concept, metacognitive monitoring and control, as well as their achievement in mathematics and literacy were evaluated. Structural equation modeling revealed that executive functioning was significantly related to metacognitive control, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and that self-concept was substantially associated with metacognitive monitoring, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Individual differences in executive functioning and metacognitive control were significantly related to academic outcomes, with metacognitive control appearing to yield a more circumscribed influence on academic outcomes (only literacy) compared to executive functioning (literacy and mathematics). Individuals differ strongly in their ability to cope with emotions, resist temptations, regulate their thoughts, and/or monitor and control ongoing cognitive and motivational processes in learning and test situations. Factors explaining individual differences in and consequences of well-developed self-regulatory skills have been targeted by empirical research and theoretical developments alike. In the literature, there are two broader theoretical conceptualizations of self-regulation, and both lines of research describe self-regulatory skills as a heterogeneous set of cognitive and affective processes allowing the individual to continuously and flexibly adjust to changing Metacognition Learning (2012) 7:151–173},

Interventions are primarily based in positive psychology but also have elements of community psychology where they aim to give teachers and students an authentic voice. When schools focus on the well-being of the whole child, this not only benefits individuals, but the communities in which they participate. Educational psychologists are in a unique position, especially in state schools. They have opportunities for conversations on well-being at all levels, to support teachers and offer in-service training. There is also an ethical issue about whether the profession acts in a pro-active way to advocate for the needs of vulnerable young people at a systemic level or is primarily reactive to demands. This paper is based in research on school change and student well-being. It summarises what it is possible to influence and which practices and processes are effective. It takes an ecological and optimistic position on change that entails sowing seeds for growth, building a team and promoting good practice. Keywords:},

  abstract = {A dual-factor model of mental health conceptualizes mental health status as a combination of both psychopathology and subjective well-being. Current literature indicates that complete mental health (i.e., low psychopathology, high subjective well-being) is associated with the best academic and social functioning among youth. Thus, the absence of psychopathology alone is not sufficient for student success. While research on interventions for improving subjective well-being, termed positive psychology interventions (PPIs), is increasing, PPIs for youth in particular lag behind similar interventions for adults. Additionally, a majority of youth-focused PPIs have targeted singular constructs (e.g., gratitude, character strengths), have neglected to include relevant stakeholders in youth's lives, and have not examined the impact of booster sessions on maintaining gains in subjective well-being. Research questions answered in the current study pertain to: (a) the impact of a comprehensive, multi-target, multi-component, small-group youth-focused PPI on students' subjective well-being and symptoms of psychopathology, and (b) the extent to which booster sessions can prevent students from experiencing post-intervention declines in subjective well-being and symptoms of psychopathology. To answer these questions, 42 seventh grade students were randomly assigned to either immediately receive the PPI or to a wait-list control group; all participants' subjective well-being and symptoms of psychopathology were analyzed across time. At immediate post-intervention, students who participated in the PPI made significant gains in all components of subjective well-being, and there was a trend for them to report less internalizing and externalizing symptoms of psychopathology relative to students in the wait-list control group. By seven-week follow-up, students who participated in the PPI exhibited sustained high levels of positive affect, and there was a trend for them to report sustained low levels of negative affect and internalizing symptoms of psychopathology relative to students in the wait-list control group. Thus, findings from the current study support this multi-component PPI as an evidence-based method for making long-lasting improvements in early adolescents' positive affect, a primary indicator of subjective well-being. Implications for school psychologists, contributions to the literature, and future directions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Il s’agira, dans un premier temps, de voir en quoi la bienveillance - maître-mot de la loi pour la refondation de l’Ecole du 8 juillet 2013 - est l’expression du care, les raisons socio-politiques qui semblent avoir présidé au choix de ce terme dans le champ éducatif, et la question de savoir si elle n’est pas une injonction paradoxale.

  abstract = {Class clowns traditionally were studied as a type concept and identified via sociometric procedures. In the present study a variable-centered approach was favored and class clown behaviors were studied in the context of character strengths, orientations to happiness and satisfaction with life. A sample of 672 Swiss children and adolescents filled in an 18 item self-report instrument depicting class clown behaviors. A hierarchical model of class clown behaviors was developed distinguishing a general factor and the four positively correlated dimensions of "identified as a class clown," "comic talent," "disruptive rule-breaker," and "subversive joker." Analysis of the general factor showed that class clowns were primarily male, and tended to be seen as class clowns by the teacher. Analyses of the 24 character strengths of the VIA-Youth (Park \& Peterson, 2006) showed that class clowns were high in humor and leadership, and low in strengths like prudence, self-regulation, modesty, honesty, fairness, perseverance, and love of learning. An inspection of signature strengths revealed that 75\% of class clowns had humor as a signature strength. Furthermore, generally class clown behaviors were shown by students indulging in a life of pleasure, but low life of engagement. The four dimensions yielded different character strengths profiles. While all dimensions of class clowns behaviors were low in temperance strengths, the factors "identified as the class clown" and "comic talent" were correlated with leadership strengths and the two negative factors ("disruptive rule-breaker", "subversive joker") were low in other directed strengths. The disruptive rule breaking class clown was additionally low in intellectual strengths. While humor predicted life satisfaction, class clowning tended to go along with diminished satisfaction with life. It is concluded that different types of class clowns need to be kept apart and need different attention by teachers.},

What strengths should be addressed in a strengths-based intervention? What is the role of signature strengths? Do strengths-based interventions change the level of character strengths? How can you justify strengths-based interventions?

  abstract = {This study quantitatively assessed the size, disciplinary reach, impact, and topic breadth of positive psychology (PP), in order to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the growth and significance of the field. Over 1.7 million documents in 700 PsycINFO® journals covering the fields of psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, management, business, public health, and sport science were analyzed using semantic and bibliographic methods. Results indicate that PP covers many different research topics from a diverse range of disciplines, and that PP literature has been growing rapidly in significance. Over 18,000 documents were identified as belonging to PP, with 2300 published in 2011. These documents represent over 4\% of PsycINFO® documents within the data-set published that year, and make PP close to the median size of all disciplines listed in the Thomson Reuters Journal Citation Reports®, Social Sciences Edition. The aggregate impact factor for PP in 2011 was 2.64},

An 18-item Emotion Dysregulation Index was developed on the basis of expert ratings of the Child Behavior Checklist. Compared to typically developing controls, children and adolescents with ASD showed more emotion dysregulation and had significantly greater symptom severity on all scales. Within ASD participants, emotion dysregulation was related to all core features of the disorder, but the strongest association was with repetitive behaviors. These findings may facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic strategies targeting emotion dysregulation in order to optimize long-term outcomes for individuals with ASD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The acquisition of social and emotional skills is associated with positive youth development, character education, healthy lifestyle behaviours, reduction in depression and anxiety, conduct disorders, violence, bullying, conflict, and anger. School-based interventions aimed to enhance these skills go beyond a problem-focused approach to embrace a more positive view of health; they could also improve the youth's wellbeing. AIM To describe the main features and to establish the effectiveness of universal school-based RCTs for children and the youth, aimed to promote their psychosocial wellbeing, positive development, healthy lifestyle behaviours and/or academic performance by improving their emotional and social skills. METHODS Systematic review by searching for relevant papers in PubMed/Medline with the following key words: "mental health" OR "wellbeing" OR "health promotion" OR "emotional learning" OR "social learning" OR "emotional and social learning" OR "positive youth development" OR "life skills" OR "life skills training" AND "school". Interval was set from January 2000 to April 2014. RESULTS 1,984 papers were identified through the search. Out of them 22 RCTs were included. While most interventions were characterized by a whole-school approach and SAFE practices, few studies only used standardized measures to assess outcomes, or had collected follow-up data after ≥ 6 months. The results of all these trials were examined and discussed. CONCLUSION Universal school-based RCTs to enhance emotional and social skills showed controversial findings, due to some methodological issues mainly. Nevertheless they show promising outcomes that are relatively far-reaching for children and youth wellbeing and therefore are important in the real world.},

  abstract = {Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and low intellectual/language abilities are often omitted from experimental studies because of the challenges of testing these individuals. It is vital to develop appropriate and accessible tasks so that this significant part of the spectrum is not neglected. The theory of mind (ToM) has been extensively assessed in ASD, predominantly in relatively high-functioning individuals with reasonable language skills. This study aims to assess the ToM abilities of a sample of 132 participants with intellectual disability (ID) with and without ASD, matched in verbal mental age (VMA) and chronological age, using a naturalistic and nonverbal deception task: the Penny Hiding Game (PHG). The relationship between performance on the PHG and everyday adaptation was also studied. The PHG proved accessible to most participants, suggesting its suitability for use with individuals with low cognitive skills, attentional problems, and limited language. The ASD+ID group showed significantly more PHG errors, and fewer tricks, than the ID group. PHG performance correlated with Vineland adaptation scores for both groups. VMA was a major predictor of passing the task in both groups, and participants with ASD+ID required, on average, 2 years higher VMA than those with ID only, to achieve the same level of PHG success. VMA moderated the association between PHG performance and real-life social skills for the ASD+ID more than the ID group, suggesting that severely impaired individuals with ASD may rely on verbal ability to overcome their social difficulties, whereas individuals with ID alone may use more intuitive social understanding both in the PHG and everyday situations.},

Effectuée principalement dans le cadre de deux paradigmes théoriques –~la théorie de la motivation à l’accomplissement et la théorie de l’autodétermination~– la recension de ces travaux montre d’une part les conséquences positives d’un climat de maîtrise et les effets controversés d’un climat de compétition, et d’autre part les bienfaits d’un style soutenant l’autonomie des élèves au contraire d’un style contrôlant. Néanmoins, l’application à la classe des principes éducatifs issus de ces études, requiert de la part des enseignants une certaine prudence. La complexité du contexte naturel d’enseignement par rapport aux situations étudiées en laboratoire, les contraintes qui s’imposent à l’enseignant, qui réduisent sa liberté pédagogique et qui le poussent à être contrôlant envers ses élèves, ainsi que les limites méthodologiques des études par questionnaire, constituent les principales réserves à avoir quant à la validité écologique de ces recherches.The purpose of this article is to report current research work on teachers’ behaviours in class and their effects on the students’ learning activities. The gathering of those studies was done mainly within the framework of two theoretical paradigms: the theory of motivation through a sense of accomplishment and the theory of students’ self-determination. It shows first the positive consequences of completely mastered environments and the debated effects of competitive environments, and then the benefits of the styles supporting the students’ autonomy; contrary to assessment-oriented styles. Nevertheless, applying the teaching principles derived from those studies to class teaching requires the teachers to be careful. The complexity of true teaching environments compared to situations developed in laboratory, the constraints on teachers that reduce their teaching freedom and make them be more assessment-oriented, and the methodological limits of questionnaire studies, give no guarantee as to the ecological validity of such research work.El objetivo de este artículo es presentar el estado de las investigaciones sobre los comportamientos del docente en clase y sus efectos sobre las actividades de aprendizaje de los alumnos. Realizadas principalmente en el marco de dos paradigmas teóricos– la teoría de la motivación a la realización y la teoría de la autodeterminación– la comparación de estos trabajos muestra por una parte las consecuencias positivas de un clima de dominio y los efectos controversiados de un clima de competición, y por otra parte los beneficios de un estilo que sostiene la autonomía de los alumnos a la inversa de un estilo que controla. Sin embargo, la aplicación a la clase de los principios educativos procedentes de esos estudios, requiere cierta prudencia por parte de los docentes. La complejidad del contexto natural de docencia en comparación con las situaciones estudiadas en laboratorio, las coacciones que se imponen al docente y reducen su libertad pedagógica y lo inducen a ser censor para con sus alumnos, así como los límites metodológicos de los estudios por cuestionario, constituyen las principales reservas que hay que tener en cuanto a la validez ecológica de estas investigaciones.Ziel dieses Artikels ist es, den Stand der Forschung über das Verhalten des Lehrers in der Klasse und deren Auswirkungen über die Lernaktivitäten der Schüler vorzustellen. Im Rahmen zweierlei theoretischer Paradigmen durchgeführt, – die Theorie der Motivierung zum Handeln und die Theorie der Selbstbestimmung – zeigt die Rezension dieser Forschungsarbeiten zwei Aspekte~: einerseits die positiven Folgen eines Klimas der Beherrschung und die bestrittenen Folgen eines Klimas des Wettkampfes~; und andererseits die positiven Auswirkungen einer Unterrichtsmethode, die die Autonomie der Schüler fördert \textbackslash (im Gegensatz zu einer kontrollierenden Methode\textbackslash ). Jedoch verlangt die Anwendung in der Klasse der aus diesen Forschungsarbeiten hervorgehenden erzieherischen Prinzipien eine gewisse Vorsicht von den Lehrern. Erstens die Komplexität des natürlichen Unterrichtskontextes im Vergleich mit den im Labor bearbeiteten Situationen, zweitens die sich dem Lehrer aufbürdenden Zwänge, die die pädagogische Freiheit einschränken und die ihn dazu führen, eine kontrollierende Unterrichtsmethode gegenüber seinen Schülern zu benutzen, und drittens die methodologischen Grenzen der über Fragebögen geführten Forschungsarbeiten sind die Hauptbedenken, die man gegenüber der ökologischen Gültigkeit dieser Forschungen äußern kann.},

  abstract = {The authors hypothesized that a social and emotional learning (SEL) program involving mindfulness and caring for others, designed for elementary school students, would enhance cognitive control, reduce stress, promote well-being and prosociality, and produce positive school outcomes. To test this hypothesis, 4 classes of combined 4th and 5th graders (N = 99) were randomly assigned to receive the SEL with mindfulness program versus a regular social responsibility program. Measures assessed executive functions (EFs), stress physiology via salivary cortisol, well-being (self-reports), prosociality and peer acceptance (peer reports), and math grades. Relative to children in the social responsibility program, children who received the SEL program with mindfulness (a) improved more in their cognitive control and stress physiology; (b) reported greater empathy, perspective-taking, emotional control, optimism, school self-concept, and mindfulness, (c) showed greater decreases in self-reported symptoms of depression and peer-rated aggression, (d) were rated by peers as more prosocial, and (e) increased in peer acceptance (or sociometric popularity). The results of this investigation suggest the promise of this SEL intervention and address a lacuna in the scientific literature—identifying strategies not only to ameliorate children's problems but also to cultivate their well-being and thriving. Directions for future research are discussed.},

Factor analysis on the goal orientation scale yielded a mastery orientation and a performance orientation. A mastery orientation was found to be associated with perceptions of competency while a performance orientation was associated with a sense of belonging and negative emotions. A structural equation modeling analysis revealed that emotions are better predictors of goal orientations than goal orientations are of emotions. The study lends support to the claim that certain goal orientations are associated with certain emotions and that emotions may be driving the goal orientations. Implications for the formation of classroom structures and remediation are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

Hope, wisdom, creativity, future mindedness, courage, spirituality, responsibility, and perseverance are ignored or explained as transformations of more authentic negative impulses. The 15 articles in this millennial issue of the American Psychologist discuss such issues as what enables happiness, the effects of autonomy and self-regulation, how optimism and hope affect health, what constitutes wisdom, and how talent and creativity come to fruition.

It therefore becomes necessary to reflect on the links between theory and practice in this domain. Indeed, referring to different psychological models constitutes a structuring dimension for professional interventions in prevention and health promotion which needs to be further developed. Moreover, research studies and interventions in the field of physical and mental health prevention seem to have grown separately and could become better articulated in order to foster greater comprehension of the protective factors.

  abstract = {Le bien-être constitue l’un des objets d’étude phare de la psychologie positive, mais peut-on considérer que le bien-être individuel contribue au bien-être collectif ? Nombre de recherches ont montré que le bien-être est à la fois un précurseur et une conséquence des conduites prosociales, en particulier concernant l’implication dans le secteur caritatif (don de temps). Cependant, peu d’études portent sur le lien entre le don d’argent et le bien-être. La présente étude teste l’hypothèse selon laquelle l’expérience de bien-être est corrélée à une inclination supérieure à faire une donation. Cette recherche a été menée dans des conditions techniques permettant de minimiser la désirabilité sociale des réponses (questionnaire informatisé en auto-passation, donc anonyme) auprès d’un échantillon de 805 personnes. Les résultats indiquent que plus les participants se déclaraient heureux, plus le montant de leur don était élevé. Cette étude apporte une contribution à la littérature en présentant une démonstration comportementale de la relation entre le bien-être subjectif et le don d’argent. Subjective well-being is one of the key positive psychology research subjects, but is it possible to consider that individual well-being contributes to collective well- being ? A number of research studies have underlined that well-being is both an antecedent and a consequence of prosocial behaviors, particularily in what concerns voluntary work (donation of time). However, few studies have worked on the link between money donation and well-being. The present study tests the assumption according to which the experience of well-being is correlated to a greater inclination to make donations. This research was carried out using technical conditions aimed at minimizing socially desirable responses by guaranteeing confidentiality through Computer Assisted Self-Interviews on a representative sample of 805 individuals from two French regions. Results show that the higher the self-reported well-being, the higher the financial donation. This study contributes to the literature by providing a behavioral demonstration of the relationship between subjective well-being and monetary donation.},

S’ensuit la traditionnelle et innocente comparaison du taux de sympathie de chaque collègue en comptant les bouteilles ou les boîtes de chocolats rassemblées en salle des maîtres. Attablés, les enseignants débattent. La jeune enseignante trouve «trop chou!» cette marque d’affection alors que le vieux roublard y voit plutôt un signe de manipulation, une tentative de corruption. Le barbu du groupe parlera, lui, d’une habitude sociale dont le sens nous a peu à peu échappé: «c’est bientôt les fêtes et on offre des cadeaux. C’est comme ça.» Au coeur de ces considérations, certains reconnaissent que le chocolat aurait un meilleur goût si le cadeau était désintéressé, signe d’une reconnaissance sincère de l’enfant et de ses parents envers le travail des professionnels de l’éducation. Mais personne ne le formule si clairement. Après tout, le salaire tombe à la fin du mois et on ne devrait pas travailler pour les mercis.},

However, a number of PPIs require relatively high levels of commitment from school administrators and teachers to put into place. This may result in many teachers dismissing PPIs across the board as too complicated to implement. The goal of the present article is thus to present a review of brief PPIs (BPPIs) based on positive psychology research in order to encourage involvement in such interventions at school. The BPPIs presented here have been categorized into four sections according to established areas of research in positive psychology, mindfulness, gratitude, strengths, and positive relationships, with precise examples of practices which have been successfully implemented and have demonstrated diverse benefits on student learning and well-being. The potential limitations of such interventions are also highlighted in order to foster best practices and cross-cultural adaptations of such projects.},

This article proposes an operational definition of kindness in school contexts and presents a synthesis of research studies showing its beneficial effects on well-being at school and on learning. Research studies have shown that negative emotions can have negative effects on memory, attention, creativity, motivation to learn and psychosocial functioning. Conversely, positive emotions can enhance learning in classrooms as well as well-being and relationship quality. Studies have also shown that training teachers to modify their interactional style in order to better respond to students’ basic psychological needs leads to higher levels of teacher and student well-being and better school performance. Kindness in school contexts can thus be considered as having positive effects on students’ and teachers’ work. This encourages further research into this field.},

In a 2-year longitudinal repeated measures design, the study assessed pre- to post-test modifications in psychological symptoms and distress and in targeted well-being factors that were promoted in the experimental but not in a wait list control condition. The findings showed significant decreases in general distress, anxiety and depression symptoms among the intervention participants, whereas symptoms in the control group increased significantly. In addition, the intervention strengthened self-esteem, self-efficacy and optimism, and reduced interpersonal sensitivity symptoms. These results demonstrate the potential benefits of evidence-based positive-psychology interventions for promoting school-children’s mental health, and point to the crucial need to make education for well-being an integral part of the school curriculum.

The current study presents a 2-year longitudinal evaluation of the effects of a school-based positive psychology program on students' subjective well-being, school engagement, and academic achievements. The study investigated the effectiveness of the Maytiv school program using a positive psychology-based classroom-level intervention with 2517 seventh- to ninth-grade students in 70 classrooms, from six schools in the center of Israel. The classes were randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions, which were comparable in terms of students' age, gender, and socio-economic status. Hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed positive intervention effects on positive emotions, peer relations, emotional engagement in school, cognitive engagement, and grade point average scores (Cohen's ds 0.16–0.71). In the control group, there were significant decreases in positive emotions and cognitive engagement, and no significant changes in peer relations, emotional engagement or school achievements. These findings demonstrate the significant socio-emotional and academic benefits of incorporating components of positive psychology into school curricula.},

  abstract = {In the present study, we examined the extent to which the responses of teachers and mothers toward a particular child are similar in respect to their instructional support and affect, and whether child characteristics predict these responses. The data of 373 Finnish child–teacher–mother triads (178 girls, 195 boys) were analysed. Teachers and mothers reported their instructional support and affective responses toward a child in the school/homework context in Grades 1, 2, 3, and 4. At the beginning of Grade 1, the children’s performance in reading and math was tested, and teachers evaluated the children’s externalizing and internalizing problem behaviour. The results demonstrated that mothers and teachers showed similar instructional support and affective responses toward a particular child at the end of Grade 1. Moreover, children’s poor performance in reading and math at the beginning of Grade 1 was associated with high amounts of both teachers’ and mothers’ instructional support at the end of Grade 1, while children’s externalizing problem behaviour was strongly related particularly to teachers’ but also to mothers’ negative affective responses at the end of Grade 1.

  abstract = {The aims of this study were, firstly, to identify different groups of teacher-child dyads on the basis of the longitudinal associations between teachers' individual support in reading and children's reading skills, and, secondly, to examine whether the groups thus identified differ with respect to various teacher- and child-related factors. A total of 372 teacher-child dyads were examined. The reading skills of 6- to 7-year-old Finnish-speaking children were measured at the beginning and end of Grade 1. The amount of teachers' support in reading for a particular child was gathered from teachers by questionnaires. Regression Mixture Modeling identified three latent groups of teacher-child dyads: Among 38\% of the dyads, teachers' increased support in reading for a particular child positively predicted the development of the child's reading skills; among 13\% of the dyads, teachers' support in reading had no association with the child's reading skills; and among the remaining 49\% of the dyads, children acquired reading skills slowly irrespective of teachers' efforts to support their learning. Teachers' individual support in reading was positively related to the reading skills for children who were initially interested in reading, and who showed low levels of externalizing problem behavior. Moreover, teachers experienced less negative affect and reported less teaching-related stress when supporting children whose reading skills were developing faster in respect to reading instruction (vs. when working with children whose acquisition of reading skills developed more slowly).},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

The theory holds that individuals with growth mind-sets (beliefs that attributes are malleable with effort) enjoy many positive outcomes—including higher academic achievement—while their peers who have fixed mind-sets experience negative outcomes. Given this relationship, interventions designed to increase students’ growth mind-sets—thereby increasing their academic achievement—have been implemented in schools around the world. In our first meta-analysis (k = 273, N = 365,915), we examined the strength of the relationship between mind-set and academic achievement and potential moderating factors. In our second meta-analysis (k = 43, N = 57,155), we examined the effectiveness of mindset interventions on academic achievement and potential moderating factors. Overall effects were weak for both metaanalyses. However, some results supported specific tenets of the theory, namely, that students with low socioeconomic status or who are academically at risk might benefit from mind-set interventions.},

In terms of internal dynamics, emotional components of engagement contributed significantly to changes in their behavioral counterparts; feedback from behavior to changes in emotion were not as consistent. Teacher support and students' self-perceptions (especially autonomy) contributed to changes in behavioral components: Each predicted increases in engagement and decreases in disaffection. Tests of process models revealed that the effects of teacher context were mediated by children's self-perceptions. Taken together, these findings suggest a clear distinction between indicators and facilitators of engagement and begin to articulate the dynamics between emotion and behavior that take place inside engagement and the motivational dynamics that take place outside of engagement, involving the social context, self-systems, and engagement itself.},

Given that the literature on parental well-being suggests that treatments that facilitate positive parental adaptation to their child’s disability may be beneficial, this study examined the impact of a strength-based approach to parent education. An alternating treatments design was used to compare the effects of therapist statements that highlighted the child’s deficits versus those that emphasized strengths. These two approaches were evaluated on the following measures: parent affect, parent statements regarding child behavior, and the quality of parent—child interactions. Results indicate that parents displayed improved affect, made more positive statements about their child, and also exhibited more physical affection toward their child during the strength-based approach. Findings have implications for autism programming, parental coping, and parent—child relationships.},

  abstract = {With contemporary classrooms becoming increasingly diverse, educational authorities, teachers and school administrators are looking to teaching and learning strategies that cater for a variety of learning profiles. A paradigm that is gaining ground in many educational circles is differentiated instruction. This model proposes a rethinking of the structure, management and content of the classroom, inviting participants within the learning context to become engaged in the process, to the benefit of all. While the model has been accepted and set to work, there remains room for theoretical support to give it momentum. A recent, comprehensive analysis of the literature in this area examines this model, within the context of increasing academic diversity. This paper therefore seeks to synthesise the research supporting a shift to a new exemplar for modern education, and in so doing shed light on the rationale supporting differentiated instruction.},

Complete data at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up was gathered from 55 sixth grade students who were randomly assigned to the intervention condition ( n = 28) or wait-list control ( n = 27). Repeated measures analyses of a propensity score matched sample of 40 participants indicated a significant group by time interaction for global life satisfaction from baseline to post-intervention. Specifically, life satisfaction of students in the intervention group increased significantly, while the control group declined during the same period (although this change was not statistically significant). The intervention group's gains were maintained at follow-up, but were matched by similar gains for students in the control group. No effects of intervention group were identified in the indicators of affect or psychopathology. The improvements in life satisfaction evidenced by students in the intervention group during the first semester of middle school are important given the adjustment difficulties that often appear during this sensitive developmental period marked by biological and educational changes.

  abstract = {Student wellbeing can be considered a major output indicator of quality of education. A positive classroom climate can contribute to a higher sense of wellbeing. Interpersonal relationships between teachers and students are an important aspect of the classroom climate. This study investigated how student wellbeing was predicted by student characteristics, interpersonal teacher behaviour and achievement. 594 students from 55 classes in 13 technical and vocational secondary schools were involved in this study. The results indicated that those students who attended school because they were highly motivated learners reported a higher sense of wellbeing than those who attended out of a sense of duty. It also appeared that student perception of interpersonal teacher behaviour predicted student wellbeing. As a case in point, when students viewed their language teacher as tolerant yet exacting discipline, a positive relationship was found with student wellbeing. Students also felt better when their mathematics teachers were less authoritarian, but the cooperative component was still important.},

The aim of the current study was to investigate the dynamics of motivational intensity model using false performance feedback. Forty participants performed a demanding cognitive task over five successive (5 min) blocks. Participants received performance feedback of either progressive success or progressive failure. A number of psychophysiological variables were used to index mental effort investment and emotion, including: HRV components, blood pressure, skin conductance level, EEG, and facial EMG. Subjective estimates of mood, workload and motivation were also collected alongside performance measures. The success group experienced positive affect and a less pronounced decline in subjective motivation in response to a perception of successful achievement. In contrast, feedback of failure led to adverse changes in mood/motivation, but did not lead to the absolute withdrawal of effort, although trends in the psychophysiological data suggest that participants in the failure group were on the verge of abandoning the task. The implications of these findings are discussed within the context of goal-setting and effort regulation models.},

Mediated models have been proposed to account for the relationships among academic emotions, cognitive/motivational variables, and achievement, and research has supported such mediated models, particularly with negative emotions.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nAIMS: The study tested the hypotheses: (1) self-regulation and the positive academic emotions of enjoyment and pride are positive predictors of achievement; and (2) enjoyment and pride both moderate the relationship between self-regulation and achievement.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nSAMPLE: Participants were 1,345 students enrolled in various trigonometry classes in one university.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Participants answered the Academic Emotions Questionnaire-Math (Pekrun, Goetz, \& Frenzel, 2005) and a self-regulation scale (Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, \& McKeachie, 1991) halfway through their trigonometry class. The students' final grades in the course were regressed to self-regulation, positive emotions, and the interaction terms to test the moderation effects.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Enjoyment and pride were both positive predictors of grades; more importantly, both moderated the relationship between self-regulation and grades. For students who report higher levels of both positive emotions, self-regulation was positively associated with grades. However, for those who report lower levels of pride, self-regulation was not related to grades; and, for those who reported lower levels of enjoyment, self-regulation was negatively related to grades. The results are discussed in terms of how positive emotions indicate positive appraisals of task/outcome value, and thus enhance the positive links between cognitive/motivational variables and learning.},

Initial evidence suggests that they also matter for school success (e.g., Weber and Ruch, 2012). The present set of two studies aimed at replicating and extending these findings in two different age groups, primary school students (N = 179; mean age = 11.6 years) and secondary school students (N = 199; mean age = 14.4 years). The students completed the VIA-Youth (Values in Action Inventory of Strengths for Youth), a self-report measure of the 24 character strengths in the VIA classification. Their teachers rated the students' positive behavior in the classroom. Addi-tionally, school achievement was assessed: For the primary school students (Study 1), teachers rated the students' overall school achievement and for the secondary school students (Study 2), we used their grades as a measure of school achievement. We found that several character strengths were associated with both positive classroom behavior and school achievement. Across both samples, school achievement was correlated with love of learning, perseverance, zest, gratitude, hope, and perspective. The strongest correlations with positive classroom behavior were found for perseverance, self-regulation, prudence, social intelligence, and hope. For both samples, there were indirect effects of some of the character strengths on school achievement through teacher-rated positive classroom behavior. The converging findings from the two samples support the notion that character strengths contribute to positive classroom behavior, which in turn enhances school achievement. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for future research and for school interventions based on character strengths.},

In the present study, four dimensions of class clown behavior (class clown role, comic talent, disruptive rule-breaker, and subversive joker) were used to investigate the associations between class clown behavior and indicators of social status and social functioning in the classroom in a sample of N = 300 students attending grades 6 to 9 (mean age: 13.09 years, 47.7\% male). Participants and their teachers completed measures of class clown behavior, and peer nominations of peer acceptance, mutual friends as well as social behavior in the classroom (popular-leadership, aggressive-disruptive, sensitive-isolated, and prosocial behaviors) were collected. The results showed that overall, class clown behavior was positively related to peer acceptance, the number of mutual friends in the classroom and peer-perceived social status. Overall, it was also positively related to peer-rated popular-leadership and aggressive-disruptive behaviors, as well as negatively related to prosocial behaviors. When considering the four dimensions of class clown behavior, comic talent was particularly relevant for the relationship with social status and with popular-leadership behaviors, but also with aggressive-disruptive behaviors. Aggressive-disruptive behaviors were also particularly related to the class clown dimension disruptive rule-breaker. The results underline the significance of class clown behavior for the social status and functioning of students and may help further understand the phenomenon in its multidimensional nature.},

This paper reviewed evidence from 15 peer-reviewed studies of school meditation programmes with respect to three student outcomes: well-being, social competence and academic achievement. In total, there were 76 results where effect sizes could be calculated. The overall number of participants in the effect size analyses was 1,797. Of the 76 effect sizes calculated, 61 \% were statistically significant. Sixty-seven per cent of the results had small effects on student outcomes, 24 \% of the results had medium effect strength and 9 \% showed a large effect of meditation upon student outcomes. Transcendental meditation programmes had a higher percentage of significant effects than mindfulness-based and other types of meditation programmes, but this may be to do with the settings and programme delivery rather than the technique itself. Programme elements such as duration, frequency of practice and type of instructor influenced student outcomes. A conceptual model is put forward based on two propositions: proposition 1—meditation positively influences student success by increasing cognitive functioning; proposition 2—meditation positively influences student success by increasing emotional regulation. Suggestions are made to stimulate future research and to assist in the development of more efficacious applications for meditation in schools.},

A sample of 196 children completed the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths for Youth, which assesses 24 character strengths, and the PANAS-C that assesses school-related positive and negative affect. Additionally, homeroom teachers rated students’ positive school functioning (i.e., motivation, engagement, and interest at school) and their overall school achievement. The character strengths of zest, love of learning, perseverance, and social intelligence showed the strongest positive correlations with school-related positive affect. Teamwork, hope, self-regulation, and love were substantially negatively correlated with school-related negative affect. Certain character strengths showed positive relationships with positive school functioning and overall school achievement. A path model, testing the “engine model of well-being”, found—additionally to direct effects—indirect relationships between character strengths and positive school functioning (through school-related positive affect), which in turn leads to higher school achievement. The presented findings show character strengths as meaningful resources in the schooling context. Character strengths emerge to be crucial for students to experience school-related positive affect, which in turn supports students’ positive school functioning and their overall school achievement. The results demonstrate the complex interplay between students’ personality traits, affect, school functioning, and achievement at school.},

Although these findings have often been used to support the implementation of educational programs based on direct instruction, we argue that guided play approaches can be equally effective at delivering content and are more developmentally appropriate in their focus on child-centered exploration. Guided play lies midway between direct instruction and free play, presenting a learning goal, and scaffolding the environment while allowing children to maintain a large degree of control over their learning. The evidence suggests that such approaches often outperform direct-instruction approaches in encouraging a variety of positive academic outcomes. We argue that guided play approaches are effective because they create learning situations that encourage children to become active and engaged partners in the learning process.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to address changes in school placement and classroom participation with respect to children with disabilities of primary school age in Norway, as well as examining the factors which explain variation in school placement and classroom participation. School placement refers to whether children with disabilities attend regular school, while classroom participation refers to time spent in regular classrooms at regular schools. The analysis is based on longitudinal data drawn from surveys undertaken in 2003 and 2006, of parents of children with disabilities. Present findings suggest there are no major changes in school placement during primary school years, which is contrary to earlier findings. However, the amount of time children with disability are absent from regular classes does increase significantly as the children become older. Size of municipality population, type of disability and degree of impairment are the main factors which have an impact on school placement. In addition to these, the amount of special education also has an impact on classroom participation. There are small changes in mechanisms that lead children out of both regular schools and classrooms, during their primary school years. However, some of the identified factors strengthen in importance as the children become older. The apparent policy change for older children, from special school placement to an "out of class" practice, is discussed.

  abstract = {Based on action research and implementation at one of the world's great schools, this book provides a much-needed exploration of how to implement positive education at a whole school level. Evidence-Based Approaches in Positive Education summarises the integration of a whole-school mental health and well-being strategy, positive psychology programs and pastoral care models from 3-18 years of age. Positive education is the teaching of scientifically validated programs from positive psychology and character education that have an impact on student and staff well-being. It is an approach that focuses on teaching, building and embedding social and emotional learning throughout a student's experience. St Peter's College - Adelaide is the only institution in the world to integrate Martin Seligman's well-being theory throughout all aspects of both its strategic intent and positive education programs. The School?s vision is to be a world-class school where all boys flourish. Its mission is to provide an exceptional education that brings out the very best in every boy. This is done within an intellectually and spiritually rich environment that nurtures international-mindedness, intercultural understanding, respect and a commitment to social justice. This book captures the developments of the St Peter's College journey. It focuses on the integration of well-being across seven strategic goals: Academics; Well-being; Student Life; Entrepreneurship; Innovation and Partnerships; People, Culture and Change; Sustainability and Environment; Community Engagement, Advancement, and Philanthropy. A uniquely Australian school, the impact of a St Peter's College education is to build great men: who believe safety, service and integrity and fundamental parts of their lives; who are active members of communities that are socially and culturally diverse; who engage in political, ethical, and environmental challenges as good citizens. Since 1847, St Peter's College alumni have had global and life-changing impact in all fields of human endeavour. The School's alumni include three Nobel Laureates, 42 Rhodes Scholars, Olympians and Archbishops, artists and scientists, educators and journalists, actors and politicians, philanthropists and physicians, CEOs, diplomats and soldiers, explorers, painters and poets.

Through a case study, we show that positive education can positively impact students, teachers, and others within the educational community, but success is not immediate nor imminent. We suggest that successful positive education programs blend evidence-based learning from the science of positive psychology, best practices in learning and teaching, whole school strategy, and evaluation, and consider pedagogy, philosophical assumptions, and the school's culture. Positive education must be studied, applied, and managed responsibly, as there is also potential that attempts are ineffective or do harm. Finally, we consider implications for training, teaching, and professional practice. Positive education has made significant progress, but future research and application will benefit from a unified theoretical framework that adequately incorporates educational knowledge and pedagogical practice.},

  abstract = {Background: Previous research in psychiatry has focused on how negative personality traits and impaired well-being form risk factors for depression. This study presents the first longitudinal test of whether the absence of positive well-being forms an additional unique risk factor for depression. Methods: A large cohort of 5566 people completed a survey at two time points, aged 51-56 at Time 1 and 63-67 at Time 2. Positive psychological well-being included measures self-acceptance, autonomy, purpose in life, positive relationships with others, environmental mastery, and personal growth. Personality was measured as extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. Depression was measured with the CES-D scale. Results: People with low positive well-being were 7.16 times more likely to be depressed 10-years later. After controlling for personality, negative functioning, prior depression, demographic, economic, and physical heath variables, people with low positive well-being were still over twice as likely to be depressed. Limitations: All measures were self-report, rather than based on peer-report or physician diagnosis. An aging population was studied; replication is needed in younger populations. Conclusions: The absence of positive well-being forms a substantial risk factor for depression, independent of the presence of negative functioning and impaired physical health. Older people with low PWB are very likely to become depressed over 10??years, and preventative intervention and monitoring of these individuals are indicated. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Strengths use led to less stress, and greater self-esteem, vitality and positive affect over both longitudinal assessment periods. Strengths use is an important longitudinal predictor of well-being, and the new scale is a reliable and valid measurement tool. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Although the concept of school engagement figures prominently in most school dropout theories, there has been little empirical research conducted on its nature and course and, more importantly, the association with dropout. Information on the natural development of school engagement would greatly benefit those interested in preventing student alienation during adolescence. Using a longitudinal sample of 11,827 French-Canadian high school students, we tested behavioral, affective, cognitive indices of engagement both separately and as a global construct. We then assessed their contribution as prospective predictors of school dropout using factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Global engagement reliably predicted school dropout. Among its three specific dimensions, only behavioral engagement made a significant contribution in the prediction equation. Our findings confirm the robustness of the overall multidimensional construct of school engagement, which reflects both cognitive and psychosocial characteristics, and underscore the importance attributed to basic participation and compliance issues in reliably estimating risk of not completing basic schooling during adolescence.},
